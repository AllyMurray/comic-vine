He built a makeshift device called Cyberno and it helped him to locate Scott. Cerebro started as a simple control pannel built into Professor X's desk. Cerebro soon grew and required a special room in the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">X-Mansion</a>. As years past, Cerebro has since then been replaced by its \"sister\" version called Cerebra and has over the years been used to find or locate many mutants, including some of the best known <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. Some of them, most notably Scott \"Cyclops\" Summers, <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>, and <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>, have relied on the device in their roles as X-Men almost as much as Xavier has himself.</p><p>At one point the X-Men villain <a href=\"/bastion/4005-40568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40568\">Bastion</a> stole Cerebro from the X-Mansion and merged with it, thus creating a self-aware version. This was done so that the human-<a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinel</a> hybrid had a means of better hunting down and killing mutants. This version of Cerebro was eventually neutralized and destroyed by the X-Men.</p><p>In recent years, the depiction of Cerebro/Cerebra in the X-Men comics has undergone a change to reflect the appearance of Cerebro in the popular X-Men films.</p><h2>Function</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192299\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0108303249097\" data-width=\"277\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 277px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192299\"><img alt=\"Emma Frost using Cerebra\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/38880/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/38880/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg 277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-width=\"277\"></a><figcaption>Emma Frost using Cerebra</figcaption></figure><p>Cerebro/Cerebra's has the ability to magnified a telepaths abilities to extreme levels.

It first appeared as the Helmet of Power in the one-shot book Iron Man and Sub-Mariner vol 1 #1 (April, 1968). Its true appearance was revealed in Sub-Mariner vol 1 #9 (January, 1969).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Serpent Crown is a powerful mystical and very dangerous object which is worn upon the head. It confers the ability to read and control minds (anyone within the sound of the voice of the one wearing the crown), superhuman strength, the power to levitate and telekinetically move others and objects, it bestows the ability to create elaborate illusions, and the crown can project massively destructive bolts of mystical energy and even the ability to manipulate energy and matter.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The crown was created by a race of Serpent Men (who had been created by <a href=\"/set/4005-29092/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29092\">Set </a>himself millennia before) allied with <a href=\"/lemurians/4060-36925/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-36925\">Lemurian </a>scientists under the direction of the Serpent God, to allow them a conduit to their god.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, when the Serpent Men were about to access the power of the Crown the Great Cataclysm occurred. This event wrought disasters all over the world, sink both <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis </a>and <a href=\"/lemuria/4020-55791/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55791\">Lemuria </a>and killing most of the remaining Serpent Men. The Crown itself would be lost for centuries.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally unearthed by a new race of Lemurians (Homo mermanus), their Emperor, <a href=\"/naga/4005-29577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29577\">Naga</a> donned the Crown and immediately fell under the control of the Serpent God. Naga wore the Crown for years, rarely taking it off and used its powers in the name of Set. Over time exposure to the Crown altered his appearance, his skin went from a pale blue to a scaly green; also over the years the Crown’s influence was also felt by the general populous altering them similarly.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually, the Crown was stolen from Naga as he slept by a rebel named Pyscatos. He and his allies fled to Antarctica where they began a civilization known as the “Ancients”, they are able to develop telepathy and other similar mental powers through the careful use of the Serpent Crown, but manage to stave off control by encasing the Crown in an unknown substance changing its appearance. These safety measures would prove to not be enough as finally Pyscatos fell under the control of Set and he caused a landslide which ended the ‘Ancient’ civilization. Again, the Serpent Crown was buried and lost, where it remained until the 20th century.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1920 Captain Leonard Mckenzie led an expedition to Antarctica where one of the members of the party, Paul Destine, discovered an odd helmet. Donning the “Helmet of Power”, Destine found that his latent psionic powers were awakened and greatly increased and his strength is greatly augmented as well. Thought lost by the rest of the expedition he is left there, but he survives by use of the remaining ‘Ancient’ technology to put himself in suspended animation. Emerging decades later, Destine found his powers further increased from his time in suspended animation.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Calling himself <a href=\"/destiny/4005-43467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43467\">Destiny</a>, he returned to the American continent just after World War II and made a bid at world domination, but was opposed by the son of Captain Mckenzie himself, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>. After Destiny swiftly defeated Namor and left him an amnesiac for decades.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually Namor arose again to battle Destiny, and during their battle Destiny’s mind snapped he attempted to use his power without the Helmet and fell to his death when he thought he could levitate. Namor took the Helmet and returned with it to Atlantis.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There the Serpent Crown begins to overcome its protective casing and mentally takes Namor’s consort, <a href=\"/dorma/4005-12601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12601\">Lady Dorma</a>, under its control and through her the rest of the Kingdom. Namor then dons the Helmet himself and through force of will frees the Atlanteans. <a href=\"/karthon/4005-29564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29564\">Karthon </a>the Quester eventually recovered the Crown along with <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor </a>as a prisoner and returned to Lemuria. Naga quickly wore the Crown upon Karthon's return and Namor stood defiant against Naga.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Namor and Naga soon engaged each other in battle while Karthon, observing Namor's nobility and Naga's sadism, was having regrets about serving Naga. Namor was about to be swallowed up by a pit created by Naga when Karthon drew his sword and killed Naga.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Namor and Karthon left the Crown on Naga and the creation of the pit caused earthquakes that swallowed Naga and the Crown beneath the ocean floor.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Crown is recovered by Warlord <a href=\"/krang/4005-13401/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13401\">Krang </a>who delivers it to the superhuman criminal, Viper who in turn kidnaps the President of Roxxon Oil and places the Serpent Crown upon his head.

Scarlet Witch engages the Serpent God on the astral plane, distracting it, as Thing manages to get close enough to Jones to remove the Crown from his head.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Serpent Crown is brought to Project: PEGASUS for study. Set exerts its influence yet again taking over the entire facility, including the then head-of-security, Quasar. The staff begins working to transport serpent Crowns from all the other dimensions to merge them with the original from Earth-616. They amass 770 such Crowns and merge them into one giant Crown in which to summon the Serpent God, but before they can finish the spell <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange</a>, <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-man</a>, Thing, and Scarlet Witch intervene and use the Cosmic Cube to destroy the giant Serpent Crown. Dr. Strange then casts an exorcising spell to remove Set from this plane forever. But with the loss of many of his talismans the spell eventually weakens.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/deviants/4060-13345/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13345\">Deviant </a>priest <a href=\"/ghaur/4005-14491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14491\">Ghaur </a>uses this opportunity to create another giant Serpent Crown in which to summon Set to this plane and is briefly successful, but Set is fought back into Limbo by <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, Thing, Dr. Strange, and <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>, and is apparently destroyed by Demogorge.

First found by <a href=\"/robby-reed/4005-5789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5789\">Robby Reed</a>, he used it to transform into a plethora of superheroes to defend his hometown from aliens, mutants, robots and a menagerie of odd disasters drawn to the dial.

Eventually, it was revealed both the Master and the Wizard were alter-egos of Robby Reed, who had separated into them by using the Dial to disarm a dead man's switch and had never been able to recover the dial to return to his normal shape until then.</p><p>The superhero <a href=\"/hero-cruz/4005-46854/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46854\">Hero Cruz</a> wielded a form of the Dial inset in his belt; it was confirmed this version functioned by merging temporarily different versions of people through Hypertime.</p><p>Dialing it backwards (O-R-E-H) produces monstrous transformations ( <a href=\"/the-new-teen-titans-mindquake/4000-29905/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-29905\">Mindquake</a>).</p><p>The H-Dial is mysterious in the sense that in spite of having been confirmed as been seen as far as 20,000 BC, it contains Interlac scripture, not invented until the time of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-heroes</a> in the 30th century. This is due to time-traveling, but the origin of the Dial is still unresolved. Several have possessed its power, and most have come to regret it. For a limited time, it transforms the user into a superhero, one different each time, though at the end of an hour, the transformation must be reversed; if this is not undone, the hero's personality starts overtaking the host mind until the original is completely rewritten. A H-E-R-O series was issued, and at its end, the Dial was lost in space in 20,000 BC.</p><h2>Final Crisis</h2><p>The alchemist <a href=\"/megistus/4005-49665/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49665\">Megistus</a> desired the Dial to aid in his alchemical quest to shield humanity from the <a href=\"/final-crisis/4045-51642/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-51642\">Final Crisis</a> by mutating it, and Robby Reed managed to defeat Megistus envoy in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> by teaming up with the <a href=\"/metal-men/4060-5712/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5712\">Metal Men</a> and lending the Dial to <a href=\"/tin/4005-13684/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13684\">Tin</a> to transform into a more resilient hero to battle the monster.</p><h2>New 52</h2><p>Following the Flashpoint event, there are multiple H-Dials scattered across the world. The creator and origin is unknown, though they have been shown to have existed in ancient times (set up and weiled by a woman named <a href=\"/laodice/4005-85598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85598\">Laodice</a>).

However, the H-Dials are not working properly, leaving the user with bizarre and impractical heroes. Manteau is trying to figure out what's wrong with the Dials, and brings Nelson on her quest. They are hunted by the 'shadow on the line', a mysterious figure who is hunting down H-Dial users (having killed <a href=\"/xn/4005-84160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84160\">Ex Nihilo</a> while she possessed a dial). Another Dial has been confirmed as being used by a hero in Canada.</p><h4>Functionality of the H-Dial</h4><p>This incarnation of the H-Dial takes the powers of heroes from alternate universes, leaving them powerless as long as they are in use. The wielders are left with false memories, and eventually can no longer differentiate themselves from the heroes they have dialed.</p><h4>S-I-D-E Dial</h4><p>Recently, Roxie and Nelson have obtained a Dial from the Canadian military that they believed to be another H Dial. However, it would not dial up a hero and while interrogating its user, who was in a coma-like state, they discovered that the sequence 7-4-3-3 was used to activate, spelling out S-I-D-E, as in 'sidekick.'

Depending on the color of the kryptonite, it has different effects. Most kryptonite only affects Kryptonians.</p><p>Kryptonite was first introduced in comics in 1949. It originated as a plot device from the Superman radio show. It's effect on Superman has become so commonly known that the word has entered the English language, defined as someone's weakness, similar to an Achilles heel or something that repulses. It can be slang for weaknesses as varied from crack cocaine to chocolate cake. \"Kryptonite\" has been licensed to a lock company.</p><h3>Forms of Kryptonite</h3><p>While Green Kryptonite is the most common form, Kryptonite has been discovered in various forms, generally differing in both appearance and effect.</p><h4>The various forms of Kryptonite are</h4><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-kryptonite/4055-57229/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57229\"><strong>Black Kryptonite</strong></a> - In comics it is capable of making <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\"> Superman</a> a darker, evil being. But it first made an appearance in Smallville (the television series) where it is actually superheated Green Kryptonite that splits psyches of anyone into two physical manifestations: the normal mind and the darker, evil personality. This Kryptonite is different in the fact that it could effect both Kryptonians and humans (Clark and <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\"> Lex</a>). The similar kryptonite also appeared in <a href=\"/superman-iii/4025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-6\"><em>Superman III</em></a> movie. Although this version of green kryptonite was laced with tar. The tar-laced kryptonite acted like a red kryptonite that removed Superman's inhibitions. Later, Superman (Christopher Reeve) was split into two beings, an evil Superman and a good Clark Kent.</p><p><a href=\"/blue-kryptonite/4055-56639/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56639\"> <strong>Blue Kryptonite</strong></a> - It is \"Green Kryptonite\" to <a href=\"/bizarro/4005-8312/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8312\"> Bizarro</a> and in some cartoons and video games it heals Superman. In <a href=\"/smallville/4020-55733/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55733\"> Smallville</a> it appears in Episode 8 of Season 7 titled \"<a href=\"/smallville-708-blue/4070-4175/\" data-ref-id=\"4070-4175\"><em>Blue</em></a>\" and it makes Kal-El powerless as long as it is in contact with his skin, but on Krypton it is considered an honor to receive it as a ring on one's finger. It's effects are reversed on Clark's \"Bizarro\" twin, super charging him until he explodes in \"<a href=\"/smallville-710-persona/4070-4104/\" data-ref-id=\"4070-4104\"><em>Persona</em></a>\" (Season 7, Episode 10). Zod tries to use a blue kryptonite knife in \"<a href=\"/smallville-922-salvation/4070-3968/\" data-ref-id=\"4070-3968\"><em>Salvation</em></a>\" (Season 9, Episode 21) to stay on Earth rather than be pulled to another dimension like his fellow Kryptonians, but takes the knife himself and Zod is sent away. In the New 52 reality it's said than blue kryptonite is the most lethal version of the mineral because induce spiritual death.</p><p><strong><a href=\"/pink-kryptonite/4055-57228/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57228\">Pink Kryptonite</a> -</strong> In <em><a href=\"/supergirl-79-many-happy-returns-part-5-strange-vis/4000-107295/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-107295\">Supergirl #79</a></em>, when <a href=\"/linda-danvers/4005-45402/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45402\"> Linda Danvers</a> takes the original Kara Zor-El's place and arrives in the Pre-Crisis era, there is a comical scene where Superman is apparently exposed to Pink Kryptonite, with the implication that it temporarily turned him gay.</p><p><strong>Green Kryptonite</strong> - By far the most common variation. Green Kryptonite can weaken those of Kryptonian descent (weakening powers and abilities as well as strength), and in large enough doses or for long enough time it is lethal. In Smallville Green Kryptonite grants normal humans or other life mutations that make them super-powered and on most occasions psychotic. Here it also weakens Clark, at varying degrees including simply making him a little more human or leaving him on the brink of death. In New 52 appearances, the Kryptonite is again referred to as being rare, is shown that can be used as an energy source, to kryptonian rockets and possible to other vehicles. The mineral doesn't take away the Superman's powers, but is able to decrease it. It is unknown if has effects on humans.</p><p><strong><a href=\"/gold-kryptonite/4055-56367/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56367\"> <b>Gold Kryptonite</b></a></strong> - It removes the abilities of Kryptonian for a maximum of fifteen seconds, though for a time there was an antidote that granted powers back for a short time.</p><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jewel-kryptonite/4055-56668/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56668\"><strong>Jewel Kryptonite</strong></a> - It comes from the Jewel Mountain range of <a href=\"/krypton/4020-30670/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-30670\"> Krypton</a>. It magnifies the <a href=\"/phantom-zone-inhabitants/4060-52655/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52655\"> Phantom Zone resident's</a> psychic powers, allowing them to project illusions into the \"real-world\" or to control the minds of non-Phantom Zone's denizens.</p><p><strong>Orange Kryptonite</strong> - Gives normal cats Isis and Snooky super powers in <em><a href=\"/krypto-the-superdog-4-beware-of-orange-kryptonight/4000-109987/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-109987\">Krypto the Superdog #4</a></em>.</p><p><a href=\"/red-kryptonite/4055-56333/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56333\"> <strong>Red Kryptonite</strong></a> - Affects Superman differently every time for up to 3 days, as no piece of Red Kryptonite has the same effect but it can cause the oddest variety of effects including such things as transformations or even being unable to see anything green. In Smallville, Red Kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions and cause him to act on all his impulses. In the New 52 DC, the red Kryptonite induce hallucinations and a lost in the grasp on reality.</p><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/silver-kryptonite/4055-56669/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56669\"><strong>Silver Kryptonite</strong></a> - Is harmless, made for Superman's \"Silver Anniversary\". Yet in Smallville it makes Superman paranoid when in his bloodstream, though in reality it was actually a hoax Kryptonite that was part of the <strong>BRAIN I</strong>nter<strong>A</strong>ctive <strong>C</strong>onstruct-(<strong>Brainiac</strong>). Silver has made it's return found encased in the Ach-Om Rashay, the Amulet of Mindfulness. Superman was drawn to it and purposely exposed himself to it. It made him \"highly unstable\" as Batman put it. Superman immediately craved brownies and cereal. He viewed the others as if they were cartoons. The only cure was to seek out the other half which countered the effects. It is unknown how much was due to the Kryptonite or how much was due to a magical spell.</p><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/white-kryptonite/4055-56667/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56667\"><strong>White Kryptonite</strong></a> - Destroys all plant life whether it is native to Krypton or not, created when Kryptonite passed through a weird space cloud.</p><p><strong>X</strong>-<strong>Kryptonite</strong> - Gives non-powered lifeforms (Humans/ Animals) superpowers for a temporary duration.

In fact, he gets weaker the farther away he is from it! But Pre-Crisis it is lethal to non-superpowered Kryptonians and killed many of them, it is their \"Green Kryptonite\".</p><p><strong>Slow Kryptonite</strong> - is a variety of kryptonite produced by <a href=\"/metallo/4005-4689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4689\"> <b><strong>Metallo</strong></b></a> that affects humans. Why it is called \"Slow Kryptonite\" is because the rays sent out by normal Kryptonite are \"fast\" (high in frequency) and synced with the accelerated Kryptonian body. Slow Kryptonite, which releases \"slow\" rays, is synced with a slow human body, allowing it to affect it. Slow Kryptonite is the \"Green Kryptonite\" to normal humans, but its effect on actual Kryptonians is unknown.</p><p><strong>Magno</strong>-<strong>Kryptonite</strong> - It was artificially created by Nero and it pulls in anything native to Krypton so that not even Bizarro or Superman can escape its pull.</p><p><strong>Bizarro Red Kryptonite</strong> - It is the \"Red Kryptonite\" to normal humans.</p><p><strong>Kryponite</strong>-<strong>X/</strong><strong>Kryptisium</strong> - <a href=\"/emil-hamilton/4005-3770/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3770\"> Professor Hamilton</a> coined this term to refer to the change that occurred to the Kryptonite that the <a href=\"/cyborg-superman/4005-12926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12926\"> Cyborg Superman</a> blasted the <a href=\"/eradicator/4005-5377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5377\"> Eradicator</a> with when it passed through the latter and struck Superman. Instead of being lethal, it restored Superman's powers. Unfortunately, it also apparently clung to him and caused him to absorb solar energy at a rapidly accelerated rate, eventually causing his powers to go out of control and his body to build more mass. Superman was purged of it after battling the Parasite. Not to be confused with X-Kryptonite.</p><p>There have also been hoax kryptonites such as Silver Kryptonite in Smallville (mentioned above), Yellow Kryptonite, Blood Kryptonite, Kryptonite Plus, Purple Spotted Kryptonite and Fake Kryptonite.</p><h3>The Kryptonite Ring</h3><p><a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\"> Batman</a> keeps a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kryptonite-ring/4055-56452/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56452\">kryptonite ring</a> inside a lead-lined compartment in his utility belt so that if Superman ever went rogue he would have a chance of controlling him. <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\"> Lex Luthor</a> once wore a kryptonite ring to protect himself from Superman.

When activated by a voice command, the Staff of One is able to cast amazing spells but never can be used more than once.","description":"<h2>History</h2><p>The Staff of One was originally wielded by <a href=\"/tina-minoru/4005-40937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40937\"> Tina Minoru</a>, mother to Nico and was immensely powerful as the dreaded <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\"> Dormammu</a> trembled at the sight of it, knowing its power. It was passed onto Nico when Tina tried to stab her with the staff, but Nico's body managed to absorb it without ill effects.</p><p> </p><p>The Staff of One is used by simply stating a word or phrase, and a spell that relates to that word or phase will occur (e.g. saying \"Smoke\" would cause the Staff of One to release smoke, or \"Caffeine Injection\" charges the target with additional energy). The major limitation of the Staff of One is the fact that each spell can only be used once; if any spell is attempted again the staff will instead have a completely random effect.</p><p>To release the Staff of One Nico must bleed and instinctively repeats the phrase, \"When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge!\". It also passes through the middle of her sternum, appearing through whatever clothing she is wearing at the time and piercing anything directly in front of Nico. Anyone can use the Staff of One, even without training or magical affinity, which is partially explained as everyone having magic but most people needing tools to bring it out.</p><p>On the Runaway's trip to New York City, in the year 1907, <a href=\"/nico-minoru/4005-1940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1940\"> Nico </a>got caught breaking into a bank that supposedly had a means to get back home. An ancestral version of the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\"> Punisher</a> knocked her out and when Nico awoke, she was in a dungeon. Nico's ancestor the Witchbreaker was carrying another magical staff called the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/witchbreakers-staff/4055-55801/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55801\">Witchbreaker's staff</a>. The Witchbreaker, in actuality Nico's great-grandmother, tortured Nico to see if she had the strength to be a powerful sorceress. After a while the <a href=\"/witchbreaker/4005-54963/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54963\"> Witchbreaker </a>deemed her worthy. Nico withstood unimaginable pain and this enabled her to gain far greater magics and transformed the appearance of the Staff of One. The staff's new form is not only much more powerful than the original Staff of One, it also increased Nico's ability to use magic without the staff.</p><p> </p><h2>Users outside the Minorus</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"/alex-wilder/4005-2249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2249\"> Alex Wilder</a> once wielded the Staff of One.</p></li><li><a href=\"/chase-stein/4005-1938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1938\"> Chase Stein</a> wielded the staff on two separate occasions.

The strongest metal known. Unbreakable and razor-sharp, it cuts through steel like a paper.   \nWithout a healing factor it is poisonous inside the body.","description":"<h2>History</h2><p>Adamantium is a virtually indestructible man-made steel alloy which does not occur in nature and whose exact chemical composition is a United States government classified secret. Adamantium is not an element: its properties do not qualify it for any known space on the Periodic Table of Elements. Rather, adamantium is a series of three closely-related compounds of Iron created through a secret process discovered by the metallurgist, Dr. <a href=\"/myron-maclain/4005-60582/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60582\">Myron MacLain</a>.</p><p>MacLain began experimenting with the process that creates adamantium as a young scientist in the employ of the United States government in the early 1940s. By accident he created a special adamantium compound, which is more durable than any form of adamantium created since, and then through another accident, fused this adamantium sample he had created with a sample of an unknown metal catalyst and the metal which is now known to have been Wakandan <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a>. The result was the large rounded specimen of alloy which is the most virtually indestructible substance known to man. This alloy specimen was given to <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> to serve as his Shield. The exact chemical composition of <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\">Captain America's shield</a> and the exact degree to which it is indestructible have never been determined, nor has MacLain or anyone else ever learned how to duplicate either the special adamantium compound used in the creation of the shield, which Is known as Proto-Adamantium, or the process which fused the Proto-Adamantium with the Wakandan Vibranium.</p><p>Over the following decades, MacLain experimented, attempting to duplicate the process that created adamantium. Finally, in recent years, although he realized that he could never again create Proto-Adamantium, he succeeded in developing the process by which the substance known as True Adamantium is created. True Adamantium is nearly as strong as the Proto-Adamantium used to create Captain America's shield, and is, for virtually all practical purposes, indestructible. The degree of indestructibility varies directly with the thickness of the adamantium. A direct blow from Thor's hammer, <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>, conveyed with the thunder god's full strength, will only slightly dent a solid cylinder of true adamantium. A sufficient mass of adamantium could survive a direct hit from a nuclear weapon.</p><p>Adamantium is created through the mixing of certain chemical resins whose composition is a United States government secret. For eight minutes after the resins are mixed, the adamantium can be molded into a particular shape as long as it is kept at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. After this brief period, the process of creating adamantium is completed, and it is cured. The extremely stable molecular structure of the adamantium prevents it from being molded further, even if the temperature remains high enough to keep it in liquid form. Only a device called a “Molecular Rearranger” can alter the form of hardened adamantium.</p><p>The United States government has shared the secret of adamantium’s composition with certain of its allies, and the secret has also fallen into the hands of various criminals, such as the <a href=\"/constrictor/4005-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2127\">Constrictor</a>, who has made special weaponry from adamantium. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> possesses indestructible claws and skeleton of true adamantium that was bonded into his bones during <a href=\"/weapon-x/4045-55956/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55956\">Weapon X</a>. The outer portion of the robotic body of <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> is also composed entirely of true adamantium, although Ultron's inner mechanisms are not.</p><p>Adamantium is extraordinarily expensive to produce, Therefore, certain parties who wish to use adamantium on a large scale have resorted to utilizing a similar, but somewhat weaker compound similar to True Adamantium called Secondary Adamantium. Although Secondary Adamantium is still far stronger than even titanium steel, it can be destroyed by sufficiently great amounts of force. <a href=\"/blastaar/4005-10963/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10963\">Blastaar</a>'s energy discharges and the vibratory force created by the Overkill Horn have both proved able to destroy Secondary Adamantium, although they would probably have little or no effect on True Adamantium. The sentient computer known as F.A.U.S.T. had a casing made of Secondary Adamantium, and the factory which housed it was also constructed to a large extent of Secondary Adamantium; both have been destroyed.

Tech darts were tipped with adamantium needles.</p><p>The US Army used Adamantium bullets on the Hulk during his rampage of New York City.</p><p>Also a Nanotech carried cure for Gamma Mutation made by <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Doc Green</a>.</p><h2>Types of adamantium</h2><h3>Proto-Adamantium</h3><p>Proto-Adamantium is the original Adamantium created by Dr. MacLain. This is the Adamantium present in Captain America's Shield. It has never been recreated.</p><h3>True adamantium</h3><p>True Adamantium is the attempt at recreation of Proto-Adamantium. It is nearly as strong/durable and is possible to be produced. It is impossible to break. It could withstand a nuclear bomb, though <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> with all his strength and <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a> has slightly dented a small cylinder of it. Being this strong, it is very rare and expensive to create/manipulate and is top secret in the US government, though it has shared it with some of their \"allies\".</p><h3>Secondary adamantium</h3><p>This type is much more easier to work with, making it much more cost effective though at the expense of its strength. Someone with super-strength (say the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>) can break it or warp it. Also referred to as Adamantium Steel.</p><h3>Adamantium Beta</h3><p>This was created by an experiment involving Wolverine. As a side effect of bonding true adamantium with his bones, and his rapid healing ability there was a molecular change which has adapted adamantium to the biology of normal bone. This Adamantium acts like a biological component, regenerating as his bones do.</p><h3>Adamantium Allotropes</h3><p>In <a href=\"/x-men/4050-2133/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2133\">X-Men</a> #191, when confronting Wolverine, one of the <a href=\"/children-of-the-vault/4060-43765/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43765\">Children of the Vault</a> named <a href=\"/serafina/4005-43771/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43771\">Serafina</a> claims that adamantium has thirteen allotropes, all of which are \"unstable, and short-lived, but virulently poisonous\". She throws a small device that clamps onto his claws and makes them glow green, claiming that it is \"adamantium nine\". This causes Wolverine to become stricken, incoherent and collapse.</p><h3>Carbonadium</h3><p><a href=\"/russia/4020-55706/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55706\">Russia</a> wanted to create its own type of adamantium, and thus carbonadium was born. This form of adamantium is not as durable as true adamantium, but it is also flexible. For most purposes, however, carbonadium is still virtually indestructible. <a href=\"/omega-red/4005-9729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9729\">Omega Red</a> is probably the best known to use this metal with his tentacles, which act as a conduit for his energy draining powers. For more information see <a href=\"/carbonadium/4055-57350/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57350\">Carbonadium</a>. Like adamantium it is poisonous to the body without a healing factor. Omega Red's healing factor is not enough to keep the poison at bay, perhaps it is more potent than adamantium or Omega Red's healing factor is less effective than Wolverine's.</p><h2>Breaking the Unbreakable</h2><p>Though adamantium is said to be unbreakable and indestructible, there have been instances when objects made of the metal have been damaged.

Upon closer inspection and the application of a little logic, it's becomes apparent that though Hulk did rip Wolverine apart, he didn't actually break adamantium. For the clearest explanation as to why Wolverine's spine, but not the adamantium, could be broken, read the following.</p><p>Satyrquaze says:</p><blockquote><p>\"As far as Hulk breaking Wolverine in half... (quick biology and metallurgy lesson here) Despite propaganda saying otherwise, Wolverine's skeleton is not completely coated with adamantium, if it were he couldn't move. Adamantium porously coats each bone individually (and it would have to be porous because blood and oxygen is required to get inside the bone to the marrow for a person to live). Also there is a malleable disc between each bone (especially in vertebrae in the spine) which allows freedom of movement along with joints and ligaments(which wouldn't be coated in adamantium if Wolverine hopes to do things like walk, stand, move in the slightest...).Now what Hulk did was indeed rip Logan apart, but it's most likely that Wolverine's spine separated at it's weakest point (the discs between each vertebra) and everything tore apart quite easily from there. So no, Hulk more than likely didn't break adamantium at all in this instance. Not to say that he couldn't if suitably pissed.\"</p></blockquote><p>Hulk can damage adamantium, or at least adamantium alloys (as seen below), but he did not do so in this instance.</p><h4>Adamantium Ball</h4><p>In <a href=\"/marvel-team-up/4050-2576/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2576\">MARVEL TEAM-UP</a> #18, Hulk fought the villain Blastaar in a factory built with an adamantium alloy (not true admantium). To defeat the enemy, he wrapped the metal around him, formed a ball, and threw him in the sea.</p><h4>MODOK</h4><p>In <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk/4050-2406/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2406\">Incredible Hulk</a> #167, the Hulk shatters <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">MODOK's</a> armor, which is an alloy of adamantium (but not true adamantium).</p><h4>Anti-Metal</h4><p>This rare substance also known as Antarctic vibranium can produce vibrations of a specific wave length that can liquefy all metal including adamantium.</p><h4>Dogs of War</h4><p>In <a href=\"/hulk-future-imperfect/4050-4793/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4793\">Hulk: Future Imperfect</a> #1, <a href=\"/maestro/4005-7865/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7865\">Maestro</a> explains that he has created mechanical dogs (Dogs o' War) with jaws capable of crushing adamantium in 7.3 seconds. That feat is never depicted on-panel. Hulk destroys the robot canine.</p><h4>Thor vs Hulk vs Statue</h4><p>In a fight with the Hulk, Thor let loose and hit him with enough power to send him flying into a statue supposedly made of pure adamantium. The base of the statue that Hulk slammed into was cracked and when the Hulk got to his feet and picked up the statue, pieces of it fell off where he grabbed it.</p><h4>Captain America's Shield</h4><p>Captain America's shield, which is an adamantium-vibranium alloy, has been broken five times in the history of comics. The <a href=\"/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a> once destroyed the shield (along with Mjolnir, IronMan's armor, and the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer's</a> board) by unmaking them on the molecular level. <a href=\"/klaw/4005-3171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3171\">Klaw</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a> (both amped by the power of <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">The Beyonder</a>) damaged the shield on separate occasions. <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>, wielding the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, effortlessly shattered the shield with a backhand. Finally, King Thor destroyed the shield with eye beams in an alternate universe.</p><h4>Guardians of the Galaxy</h4><p>On the 31st century Earth that the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> hail from there are several metals that are capable of piercing adamantium. The Punishers of that era shot <a href=\"/major-victory/4005-2166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2166\">Vance Astro</a> with a bullet made of Dragonite that punctured his adamantium body mesh. Dragonite is said to be invented by the 26th century.</p><h4>Omega Hulk</h4><p>After an Extremis infused brain surgery gave rise to an all new and incredibly cunning as well as dangerous Hulk Persona (Who may be, in point of fact, a precursor to the Maestro) singlehandedly tore off a piece of pure raw adamantium; an arm, from one of the original bodies of Ultron that was lingering within Kang the Conqueror's citadel at the end of time.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Films</h3><h4><a href=\"/x-men-origins-wolverine/4025-25/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-25\">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4206706\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.png\" data-ratio=\"0.53333333333333\" data-width=\"1500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4206706\"><img alt=\"Liquid adamantium\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.png 1500w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4206706-7035559806-Adama.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Liquid adamantium</figcaption></figure><p>Logan is given his adamantium skeleton.</p><h4><a href=\"/x2-x-men-united/4025-23/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-23\">X-2: X-Men United</a></h4><p><a href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a>'s lab is shown to have an adamantium infusion chamber where both Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike were created.

It is able to absorb any vibrations and kinetic energy directed at it as its molecules behave as if at absolute zero. Because of this, it has been a highly sought after material to be weaponized.","description":"<h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Vibranium is an extraterrestrial metallic ore known to exist on Earth in <b>numerous forms</b>. The largest known deposit comes from a meteorite that crashed on Earth approximately 10,000 years ago.</p><p>Vibranium, contrary to some reports, is not an element. Vibranium is not radioactive, as all elements with high atomic weights are. (All newly discovered elements must have higher atomic weights than the known elements.)</p><p>Vibranium's electrons do not move, meaning that vibranium's molecules are constantly at a temperature of 0 degrees Kelvin (absolute zero). This lack of motion on the molecular scale means that vibranium is physically incapable of transferring force, making it the most durable substance in the Marvel Universe. (Note: adamantium is more dense than vibranium and is thus more lethal, but vibranium is better for defensive purposes as it is can withstand nearly unlimited amounts of force.)</p><h3><i>Wakandan Vibranium</i></h3><p>Most of the aforementioned meteor, consisting of the more <b>common variety of vibranium</b>, landed in the what is now the African nation of <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a>. Even though deposits have been found in other locations, due to the fact that Wakanda is the first known source in existence is the reason why it continues to be known as Wakandan vibranium.</p><p>Wakandan Vibranium has the unique property to absorb vibratory waves such as sound as well kinetic energy by somehow storing this energy within it's molecular bonds. The more energy it absorbs, the stronger the molecular bonds become until the vibranium is extremely difficult to damage or destroy.</p><p>This makes vibranium highly prized for its durability. Although not as hard or dense as <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium</a>, few other substances can equal it in durability. In addition vibranium is much easier to shape and manipulate than adamantium and remains unsurpassed in it's ability to absorb impacts and to absorb noise and sound.</p><p>Although vibranium is extremely difficult to destroy, it is not impossible. There is an upper limit to the amount of energy vibranium can safely absorb, however this has yet to be determined. Doing so is incredibly dangerous as once the molecular bonds are shattered it causes all of the energy stored within those molecular bonds to be released at once resulting in an incredibly powerful explosion.</p><p>Wakandan vibranium also has the power to greatly amplify mystical energies. It is highly unstable when used this way, as it taps into an energy flow on the Quantum Level that is virtually infinite.</p><p>Wakandan vibranium is a powerful mutagen. Exposure to vibranium has led to the mutation of several Wakandan natives such as <a href=\"/vibraxas/4005-11460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11460\">Vibraxas</a> and <a href=\"/vibrania/4005-59584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59584\">Vibrania</a>. It is theorized that it has also altered Wakandan flora and fauna such as the <a href=\"/heart-shaped-herb/4055-43809/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-43809\">Heart-Shaped Herb</a> that is eaten by the <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a> to bestow upon their physical enhancements and the White Gorillas of Wakanda whose flesh and blood gives the White Gorilla Cult their enhanced strength and powers.</p><h3><i>Antarctic Vibranium</i></h3><p>The <b>second form of vibranium</b> exists in <a href=\"/antarctica/4020-55940/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55940\">Antarctica</a>, within the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a> and is known as Antarctic Vibranium. Unlike the Wakandan version, this type does not absorb vibratory waves but instead generates a unique vibration field that breaks down other metals that is in close proximity to. A single piece of Antarctic vibranium can reduce any metal into a liquid or near liquid-like state. Because of this unique property, it has been more commonly referred to as <i>\"Anti-Metal\"</i>. Even the molecular structure of Adamantium can be affected by sufficient exposure to Antarctic vibranium.</p><p>It has been theorized this version of vibranium was exposed to particle bombardment which severely altered it's molecular structure. Theoretically, the Wakandan vibranium could also be converted to the Antarctic vibranium type.</p><p>If the Vibranium Mound in Wakanda were it composed of Anti-Metal instead; it would produce vibrations that would liquefy all metals throughout the entire continent. If Anti-Metal was compiled in a large enough mass, the vibrations would be increased logarithmically as more is amassed.</p><p>It is unknown if the process can be reversed and Antarctic Vibranium can converted back into Wakandan Vibranium.</p><h3><em>Reverbium</em></h3><p>An <strong>artificial form of Vibranium</strong> created at Horizon Labs. <b>Reverbium</b> was conceived by Sajani Jaffrey after most of the Vibranium in the world was rendered inert in the Doomwar aftermath. This imperfect variant channeld and redirected sound based energy while steadily amplifying it over time, with many unscrupulous individuals seeking to make it a powerful weapon to be used or sold to the highest bidder. The faux alloy was thought to be destroyed when Spider-Man deployed an Anti-Metal Spider Tracer to melt down the only known repository of which that was stolen by the <a title=\"Phillip Urich (Earth-616)\" href=\"/phil-urich/4005-2246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\">Hobgoblin</a> for the <a title=\"Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)\" href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Wilson Fisk; The Kingpin</a>. Sajani had actually kept some bits of her failed replacement metal for her own private study.</p><p>Sajani wasn't the only one interested in the valuble yet unstable element. As some A.I.M scientists were making more of and studying the substance for their own purposes in their private labs for quite some time. Eventually coming under the influence of Klaw, who learned that this man-made Vibranium could amplify his sound based powers to unfathomable degree's. Reverbium's main fault despite it's potency is that its atomic structure is incredibly unstable compared to the purer, naturally occurring isotopes. Because of this it is largely less resilient than true blue Vibranium; both Antarctic or Wakandan variety. Black Panther managed to use specialized particle bombardment that caused the metal's subatomic structure to deteriorate into nothing.</p><p>Despite this fault however, through a combination of his unique semblance and A.I.M.s own cache of Reverbium, his control over sound had reached an even greater range and effect. Using his powers in conjunction with it to subtly influence the actions of the scientists under his thrall in order to test the operational limitations of the alloy's augmentative properties. Intending to use his bolstered powers channeled through the Reverbium in order revive his unresponsive sister Julia to a semblance of life after she was lobotomized by their uncaring parental figures. Hoping to resurrect her consciousness as a soniokinetic entity using a neuropsychic energy transfer of one of Wakanda's rogue Dora Milaje warriors as a focal point.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Approximately 10,000 years ago, a large meteorite composed of vibranium crashed in Africa in the now modern-day nation of Wakanda.

The crystals were discovered by the Inhuman geneticist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14594\" href=\"/randac/4005-14594/\" slug=\"randac\">     Randac</a> around 25,000 years ago. Randac exposed himself to the Mists giving himself incredible mental powers. Because Randac wished all <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\" href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" slug=\"inhumans\">   Inhumans</a> to undergo the Terrigen Mist treatment (a process known as <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42287\" href=\"/terrigenesis/4015-42287/\" slug=\"terrigenesis\">     Terrigenesis</a>), the majority of the Inhuman population became deformed monsters. After centuries of experimenting with birth control and genetics, the Inhumans have been able to expose themselves and not become monsters. However, even after all these centuries, it has not been perfect. Some Inhumans that were exposed became devolved, mindless beings. They were called the Alpha Primitives and were used as slaves. As a preventative measure, all Inhumans are subject to genetic screening before exposure to the mists in order to ensure compatibility with the process. Terrigenesis has became a sacred ritual of the Inhumans, and a cornerstone of Inhuman Culture.</p> <p>Approximately 100 years ago the Inhuman scientist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44354\" href=\"/ultarnt/4005-44354/\" slug=\"ultarnt\">     Ultarnt</a> was commissioned by the Genetic Council to do a study on the nature of Terrigenesis. The results of this study could result in a deeper understanding of the Inhuman rite of passage. It was learned that the process was not random as has always been seemingly apparent, but instead follows a greater and possibly discernible pattern. It was identified that in times of climate change Terrigenesis would favor mutations that would allow Inhumans to adapt. In times of war or conflict other appropriate mutations would arise. When an integral member of Inhuman society would die a replacement mutation would occur within a matter of three years. The far-reaching implications of this study were deemed too provocative for the general public and as such have been kept secret from most of Inhuman society, including members of the Royal Family. </p> <p>When the mutant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\" href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" slug=\"quicksilver\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\" href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" slug=\"quicksilver\">Quicksilver</a> stole the Terrigen Mists and Terrigen Crystals the crystals eventually ended up in the hands of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40667\" href=\"/one/4060-40667/\" slug=\"one\">     ONE</a>, who refused to return them to the Inhumans.

Mutations very greatly in function and level of power.

Only the wearer of the Tallus can communicate using it. Tallus communication is usually vocal, but it can also be used to manifest holographic projections which can be seen by the wearer.

She brought him back from the dead and gave him the gauntlet with the agreement that he do something about the imbalance of life in the present day. Thanos spent time at the <a href=\"/infinity-well/4055-42405/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42405\">Infinity Well</a>; the supposed source of all universal knowledge. In his research he discovered the true nature of the Infinity Gems.

He kept his promise to Mistress Death by eliminating 50% of the universe's population. All of Earth's mightiest superheroes that remained fought against Thanos in an attempt to stop him.

Hence, <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a> stepped in to help Earth and it's heroes. Thanos lost the gauntlet to <a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a>, and she subsequently lost it to Warlock. Warlock used the Gauntlet and became a god. In order to make himself a noble god he subconsciously expelled all good and evil from his being creating the <a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a> and the <a href=\"/goddess/4005-9477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9477\">Goddess</a>.

He planned to make a machine that could help him acquire the Infinity Gauntlet that would be free from the Living Tribunal's decree that the gems would no longer work in unison. Magus forced Eternity into a coma like state and created warped doppelgangers of every hero on Earth with the <a href=\"/dark-thanos/4005-27416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27416\">clone of Thanos</a> working as his right hand man.</p><p>Earth's mightiest heroes were forced to team-up with Thanos and <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> to stop Magus. Warlock took back all the gems and tried to use the Gauntlet with little success. They then realized that the ruling from Eternity was still in affect. Galactus traveled to speak with Eternity and the Living Tribunal to have the ruling on the use of the Gauntlet reversed. However, Eternity was the only entity that could reverse the decree, and he was still in a coma. Galactus set about restoring him with the help of <a href=\"/gamora/4005-6806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6806\">Gamora</a>. Meanwhile, Magus kidnapped Warlock, stealing the Infinity Gauntlet from him and held him them prisoner in his citadel.

Magus then froze everyone and teleported them into his citadel to become his trophies, but he was ambushed by Thanos who had been fighting his own doppelganger in another part of the citadel. Warlock broke free of his restraints and grabbed a hold of the Gauntlet while Magus was still wearing it. Because of Warlocks greater knowledge of how to use the Gauntlet, and the fact that the Reality Gem which Warlock inserted in the gauntlet was a fake, he was able to overpower Magus and absorb him back into his body. Eternity and Infinity then appeared and pronounced that no matter what the circumstances, the gems would never work in unison ever again. The gems were divided up once again among the Infinity Watch.</p><h3>Illuminati</h3><p>Reed Richards calls the group together and reveals to them that he has been gathering the infinity gems and the Gauntlet, and that three of the gems were already in his possession. After they manage to gather the remaining gems, the Watcher appears before them and warns Reed that the power the gauntlet contains is too much for one man to wield on his own.

Anyone with the knowledge of the whereabouts of the gems can obtain the Gauntlet, but it takes much more than holding the Gauntlet to wield its power. Like the gems themselves, it takes much knowledge and discipline to accurately use the near infinite power of the Gauntlet and become a God.</p><p>Ultimately, the power of the Infinity Gauntlet is not meant for mortals, as mortals are not meant to be gods. This is evident in conversations between Thanos and Adam Warlock, both having achieved and lost their godhood. Both had voluntarily given up their power, realizing that it was not theirs to have. After giving up their power, the knowledge and godliness they had slowly melted away, becoming just a haunting reminder of the immense power and responsibility they once had.</p><p>Those who have wielded the Infinity Gauntlet:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a></li><li><a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a></li><li><a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a></li><li><a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a></li><li><a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a></li><li><a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a></li><li><a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a></li><li><a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a></li></ul><h2>Other Realities</h2><h3>Earth-1610</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4381580\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5087412587413\" data-width=\"572\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 572px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4381580\"><img alt=\"The Hulk with the Infinity Gauntlets\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg 572w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Hulk with the Infinity Gauntlets\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg 572w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4381580-6357762969-ultim.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hulk with the Infinity Gauntlets</figcaption></figure><p>In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Infinity Gems actually combine to form two separate Gauntlets.

If the bearer lacks the proper control, concentration, or power then the Nullifier will destroy the bearer as well and possibly the universe itself. While the origins of the Nullifier are largely unknown, it had been revealed that the Ultimate Nullifier is an aspect of Galactus himself.

He sent the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> to find the Nullifier, which was located at a secret location. With the Nullifier in hand, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> threatened to use it against Galactus. This frightened Galactus so much that he left Earth and vowed never to attempt to consume it ever again unless he had no choice.</p><p>The Ultimate Nullifier later appeared inside Galactus' starship during the Infinity War. Galactus had left <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> and a number of Earth’s heroes aboard his starship as he pleaded his case, on behalf of <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a>, to allow the <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a> to function as one. As soon as he left, the <a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a> appeared and kidnapped Warlock. Thanos was running out of options and asked <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Susan Storm</a> about the Ultimate Nullifier’s location. Nervously, she betrayed it’s location with a look. Thanos picked it up and mentioned how powerful and dangerous the weapon was, adding that it would require a far nobler soul than his own to fire it. He then hand-picked <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> out of the group of assembled heroes and asked: \"How steely is your resolve, Quasar?\". Quasar took the Nullifier and, in an effort to learn as much as he could about it, consulted <a href=\"/epoch/4005-6143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6143\">Epoch</a>.</p><p>When Quasar arrived in the Magus’ dimension he was (unbeknownst to him) blanketed with an energy dampening field which disrupted the Nullifier, but not the power of his <a href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\">Quantum-Bands</a>. When the controls of the dampening field were later damaged by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a> and <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang the Conqueror</a>, Quasar was able to activate and slowly build power in the Nullifier, only to have the devastating effect turned against him by the Magus wielding an incomplete <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> empowered by the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">Living Tribunal</a>.</p><p>The Nullifier was next used when <a href=\"/morg/4005-7122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7122\">Morg</a> took it from the hold in Galactus' ship in an attempt to defeat <a href=\"/tyrant/4005-7123/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7123\">Tyrant</a>. The power of the Nullifier was temporarily contained by the <a href=\"/toady-drone/4005-63645/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63645\">Toady-Drone</a>, which attached itself to Morg and fused them all together. Eventually the power build-up was too great and it ignited, destroying Galactus' ship and all on board.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"/abraxas/4005-18246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18246\">Abraxas</a>, the embodiment of destruction, attempted to destroy all reality with the Nullifier. But first he needed to locate it as it was again in Uatu's secret hidding place. Uatu could not divulge the location of his secret hiding place because he was in a coma. So, since Johnny Storm was the only one to have ever been to Uatu's secret location, he was sent to find it before Abraxas could. The other members of the Fantastic Four went into the bodies of other realities versions of themselves so they could scan that particular reality's Torch to find all the clues as to the Nullifier's location. After scanning the minds of Torch's from other realities, Johnny Storm of this reality was able to find the Nullifier. The Torch was then betrayed by an alternate reality <a href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\">Frankie Raye</a>, who was the Herald of Abraxas. She took the Nullifier from Johnny and gave it to her master. When <a href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\">Valeria</a> and <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a> helped to resurrect Galactus, he demonstrated his ability to effortlessly call the Nullifier to his person. He then gave it to Reed Richards who used it to destroy Abraxas in our reality, which then reset itself to normal.</p><h2>Alternate Futures and Realities</h2><p><b>The Black Celestial Saga</b></p><p>When the Earth-616 Fantastic Four traveled to the future to stop Galactus (who had been tampered with by the <a href=\"/black-celestial/4005-28795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28795\">Black Celestial</a>) from absorbing the entire universe, they realized that the Ultimate Nullifier was the only thing that could stop him. Richards even theorized that the Nullifier was Galactus' emergency failsafe, created for just such an occasion when his hunger would grow to outsized proportions. They gave Galactus the Nullifier and he used it to destroy himself.</p><p><a href=\"/captain-america-the-korvac-saga/4050-37350/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37350\"><b>Captain America and the Korvac Saga</b></a></p><p>In this all ages story in an unknown alternate universe, <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> teamed up against <a href=\"/korvac/4005-14467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14467\">Korvac</a>. Captain America was about to use the Ultimate Nullifier against him but didn't, his moral code wouldn't let him kill. Korvac then grabbed the Nullifier from Capt.

This plan fails, as Doom expected someone would try and use it against him, and so uses his powers to brainwash Medusa.</p><p>In a side mission later on, players have to find the Ultimate Nullifier (which has been damaged). If it is found, Mr. Fantastic will one day fix it, and use it to repel Mephisto. If it isn't, then the team of heroes will have to join together again to stop Mephisto, with the resulting battle causing a massive amount of damage.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-8546/","id":8546,"name":"The Startling Saga of the Silver Surfer","issue_number":"50"},"id":40946,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/1686634-nullify.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Earth-616 Mr. Fantastic,Earth-616 Ultimate Nullifier"},"name":"Ultimate Nullifier","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ultimate-nullifier/4055-40946/","start_year":"1966"},{"aliases":"Tesseract","api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-40949/","count_of_issue_appearances":305,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2021-04-11 18:06:05","deck":"Cosmic Cubes are among the most powerful objects in the universe.  They are created out of energy from another dimension.

The Cosmic Cubes are able to rewrite reality and do virtually anything their master wishes. A Cube's master is able to create planets, augment or negate other people's powers and skills, and so on. The Cosmic Cubes are created by the \" <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Beyonders</a>\" from the unknown dimension of Beyond. The Beyonders made the Cosmic Cubes in order to test people's desire and evolution processes. The Beyonders also desired change in the omniverse.</p><p>The Cosmic Cube could only be obtained by projecting a particular type of energy which would open a rift to the source of the Cosmic Cube's power. The cosmic energy flows through the rift and is then stored in a matrix.</p><h2>Cosmic Cubes</h2><h3>Skrulls</h3><p>The <a href=\"../../skrull/12-43139/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Skrull</a> scientists obtained a Cosmic Cube. The Cosmic Cube then developed sentient life and called itself the <a href=\"../../shaper-of-worlds/29-13889/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shaper Of Worlds</a>.

The Shaper of Worlds betrayed the Skrull emperor and destroyed a large part of the kingdom.</p><p>He then went on to tutor other sentient Cubes.</p><h3>Cosmic Cubes on Earth</h3><p>The Cosmic Cube was first discovered by A.I.M. in an experiment with an energy called \"X element\". The A.I.M. wanted to study of the strange energy which mutated George Tarleton into the powerful MODOK. The energy was so powerful that it was able to drive MODOK mad. The <a href=\"../../red-skull/29-2250/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Red Skull</a> wanted to steal the Cosmic Cube and succeeded in doing so. Despite the Cube's omnipotent powers, the Red Skull easily overpowered <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Captain America</a> but later loses the Cube as the Red Skull was too confident. However, the Cosmic Cube altered reality which caused an entire island to sink and was then believed to be lost forever.</p><p>A fisherman discovered the lost Cube and transformed his village into a rich place. The Red Skull finds out about the lost Cube and sends his allies to obtain it for him. The Red Skull takes back the Cube and tries to confront Captain America again. However, the Skull loses the Cube to A.I.M. and MODOK and the Cube is apparently dissolved.</p><h3>Retrieving the Cube</h3><p><a href=\"../../modok/29-3709/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> MODOK</a> eventually retrieved the Cube but lost it to <a href=\"../../thanos/29-7607/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Thanos</a> the mad Titan who used the energy of the Cosmic Cube to win Death's heart. Thanos, realizing the Cube's tremendous power, uses it to confront the Avengers and Captain Marvel. Before losing the Cube, Thanos absorbed the Cube's energy and becomes virtually omnipotent. Thanos then realized that he now has no need of the Cube and abandoned the Cube's energy. The Cube's energy is reabsorbed into the Cube once again and Captain Marvel uses the Cube to return everything back to normal but instead burns out all of the energy stored in the Cube.</p><p>The Cube is then confiscated by <a href=\"/project-pegasus/4060-56560/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56560\">Project: Pegasus</a> or research.

It satisfies others' desires. <a href=\"../../molecule-man/29-11880/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Molecule Man</a> accidentally opened a rift through the atomic machine and traveled to the source of the Cosmic Cubes power. However, the cosmic forces which went through the rift hadn't been stored in a matrix which allowed the birth of the <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beyonder</a>.</p><p>The Shaper of Worlds and Kubik explained the origin of the Cubes to the Beyonder and the Molecule Man, and then helped them become a new Cube, which eventually evolved into <a href=\"/kosmos/4005-20023/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20023\">Kosmos</a>.

After his defeat the cubes were secretly stolen by the <a href=\"../../goddess/29-9477/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Goddess</a>. She continued to gather more and more cubes from different dimensions.</p><p>In the end, she had collected 30 cosmic cubes. She combined them into one single force called the <a href=\"../../cosmic-egg/18-56066/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Cosmic Egg</a>. She used it to brainwash the entire universe.At the time, this was the most powerful creation in existence. This is the beginning of the <a href=\"../../infinity-crusade/39-42235/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Infinity Crusade</a>.</p><p>It was revealed by <a href=\"../../mephisto/29-2635/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Mephisto</a> that the Cubes were once sentient beings and their morals apply to the wishes that can be granted, and not all things are possible with the cubes. This can be overridden though, if enough people wish the same thing in unison it can go against the cubes own wishes. He exchanged this information in exchange for a cube of his own when the Goddess was defeated. <a href=\"../../thanos/29-7607/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Thanos</a> did follow through on this bargain, but tricked Mephisto by giving him a powerless cube, saying Mephisto never specified that he wanted one with any power.</p><h3>The Red Skull</h3><p>The Red Skull was still obsessed of the Cube's powers and created imbalance Cosmic Cubes. The imbalance Cubes were taken by Korvac and later the Grandmaster. The other Cube was seemingly rendered useless.</p><h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3><p>In order to stop all possible futures from becoming futures ruled by the Magus, <a href=\"../../kang/29-2264/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Kang the Conqueror</a> gives the last remaining Cosmic Cube to <a href=\"../../starlord/29-10957/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Starlord</a> in order to defeat him.

With the power of the Cube, Thanos would attempt to control all of creation. Thanos was narrowly defeated, and at an incredible cost of lives. Later in history the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Fantastic Four</a> would encounter Thanos in his home dimension after meeting the <a href=\"../../seed-nineteen/65-51537/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Seed Nineteen</a>. The Four escaped Thanos, but unknown to the team Thanos had seized this opportunity by planting the idea for the Cube's design in the one person capable of creating one: <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Reed Richards</a>. Reed realized the spectacular power that the Cube could generate, and was fixated on creating one. In his first attempt to harness the kind of power needed to create the Cube Reed locked onto what he thought was a distant star, and summoned the <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Silver Surfer</a> to Earth. Seeing the unhappiness and suffering of the Earth's residents the Surfer summoned his master the <a href=\"../../psycho-man/29-7112/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Psycho Man</a>.</p><p>When Reed finally succeeded in creating a Cosmic Cube he caught Thanos's attention. Reed attempted to use the power of the cube to protect New York City and the entire city was lifted out of the Earth to Thanos's dimension. Thanos's power was far greater than Reed's, and even though Reed had the Cosmic Cube he was inexperienced in its use and unable to defeat Thanos. Reed was seemingly killed by Thanos, but actually changed himself into an energy being to escape obliteration. <a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Ben Grimm</a>, with the help of Thanos's daughter, was able to bring Reed back out of the shell he had created for himself. They traveled back to Earth where Thanos had already enslaved many of Earth's most powerful heroes. They were able to distract Thanos long enough for Reed to give himself back his body. In order to defeat Thanos, Reed would unlock a small portion of the Cube's power which he had previously blocked off. With this safeguard gone, Thanos's body quickly died and disintegrated.</p><p>Thanos's own infatuation with <a href=\"../../death/29-12620/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Death</a> would be his undoing. His desire to be dead overcame him and killed him. In trying to decide what he would do with the all-powerful Cosmic Cube he would fulfill the ancient legend of how Thanos originally came to find the Cube.</p><p>Reed opened a very small rift in space and time. He dropped the Cube through the rift above Thanos's planet, which plummeted to the ground and landed by a younger Thanos. In this paradoxical move, the Cosmic Cube which Reed developed would be the original Cube that Thanos had discovered and nearly destroyed the universe with so long ago.</p><h3><b>Post Ultimatum</b></h3><p>The Blueprints for the construction of the Cosmic Cube were stolen from the <a href=\"../../baxter-building/34-41454/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Baxter Building</a> by <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> A.I.M</a> with the help from the <a href=\"../../red-skull/29-2250/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Red Skull</a> who was apparently some how came out of retirement, during the theft the Red Skull brutally beats up <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Captain America</a> and throws him out of the Helicopter taking the Blueprints.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245680\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2845601436266\" data-width=\"1114\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1114px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245680\"><img alt=\"A completed Cosmic Cube\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" data-width=\"747\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg 1114w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg 747w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A completed Cosmic Cube\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg 1114w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64293/1245680-avengers__104_.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" data-width=\"747\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A completed Cosmic Cube</figcaption></figure><p>It is later revealed to the Team that the blueprints that had been stolen where of the Cosmic Cube and that the A.I.M are Two days away from the completion of the Cosmic Cube but when the <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Avengers</a> the black ops of the S.H.I.E.L.D. go to A.I.M's base of Operations in Alaska it is revealed that the Cosmic Cube is finished and the Red Skull has used it to kill every member of A.I.M by making them eat each other.</p><p>The <a href=\"../../red-skull/29-2250/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Red Skull</a> uses the power of the Cube as an advantage over the <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Avengers</a> but he isn't in full control of the Cube as he states while battling the Avengers that he needs practice.

Uru is formed from the core of a dying star.","description":"<h2>Properties &amp; Characteristics</h2><p>Uru is a substance that is both stone and metal. Nothing less than the heat from a star, or the very forges of Asgard will provide sufficient heat to shape and mold the metal. It is because of this, weapons forged using this metal, especially those that are further enchanted, are highly resilient to damage. The most famous of these is Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. Due to its incredible durability and resistance to damage, its ductility is impossible to determine, and it is unknown if Uru can be drawn into wire.</p><p>It was <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, who first discovered this metal's natural affinity for magic. It has shown to be capable of storing vast amounts of energy, particularly magical energies. While not easily enchanted, Uru metal absorbs magic like a sponge, redirecting it and enhancing the natural attributes of its wielder. The enchanting process also dramatically increases its durability. Tony Stark's \"Thorbuster\" Armor, is fueled by Uru. This allowed it to channel a full blast of lightning from Mjolnir and the <a href=\"/the-odin-force/4015-35070/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-35070\">Odinforce</a> into a blast from its Uni-beam.</p><p>A symbiotic relationship between Uru and its wielder exists that allows for many astounding feats: a mystical user, such as Thor, can lend his own strength to the Uru in his hammer, thus making the metal stronger and more resilient.</p><p>As a unique Asgardian element, Uru is extremely resilient and has an extraordinary ability to hold magic.

This form also grants him vast superhuman strength.</li></ol><h2><b>Availability &amp; Production</b></h2><p>Uru metal is unique to the dimension of Asgard. It is prized most by Dwarven miners and smiths, serving as their chief export.</p><h2>Note:</h2><p>Uru's physical characteristics are difficult to measure, due to the fact that nearly all known samples are also heavily magically enchanted, making accurate measurements of its properties nearly impossible. Depending on the method or nature of the enchantment, the physical characteristics, more often than not, vastly differ from one another. <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>, for example, has proven itself capable of withstanding immense force and physical strain (e.g. Channeling both the energy of the Storm and the Odinforce to dent Captain America's shield) while Uroc's hand was shattered (following exposure to liquid nitrogen) with a gunshot.</p><h2><b>Precaution:</b></h2><p>Applying a permanent enchantment to Uru is very dangerous and should only be attempted by those of immense power, well versed in both the enchanting and crafting of the metal. Despite its incredible ability to store and harness vast quantities of energy, (especially those of a mystical nature), the casting of a permanent enchantment can cause the Uru to become dangerously volatile, and unstable. Often causing more harm than good. Although this isn't always the case, as shown by how Odin enchanted mjolnir without much trouble.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-6464/","id":6464,"name":"Sandu, Master Of The Supernatural","issue_number":"91"},"id":40970,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10812/5492978-uru.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"Uru","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/uru/4055-40970/","start_year":"1963"},{"aliases":"Hammer of Thor\r\nThor's hammer\r\nMjölner\r\nMjölnir\r\nMjølner\r\nMjollnir","api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-40971/","count_of_issue_appearances":3323,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2021-02-13 06:37:16","deck":"Mjolnir (pronounced myawl-nir) is the enchanted hammer wielded by Thor.

It has a long metal hilt made of Uru and is wrapped in a strip of leather with a thong to secure it around the bearer's hand. Mjolnir means \"That Which Smashes\". When the dwarves started to build Mjolnir, they used the inner core of a star as a mold and while they were shaping the hammer inside the core, the star went supernova and killed off the dinosaurs. When Mjolnir was finished, <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a> first used it to defeat the leader of the <a href=\"/frost-giants/4060-57102/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57102\">Frost Giants</a>, <a href=\"/laufey/4005-31821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31821\">Laufey</a>.

Those who are worthy of wielding Mjolnir gain all of Thor's powers (with the exception of the godblast). Other than Thor, some others who have been able to wield Mjolnir include: <a href=\"/awesome-android/4005-4944/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4944\">Awesome Android</a>, <a href=\"../../beta-ray-bill/29-6139/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beta Ray Bill</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, Jane Foster, <a href=\"../../red-norvell/29-12720/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Red Norvell</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thunderstrike/4005-7611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7611\">Thunderstrike</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>. As Thor's ancestry Odin, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bor/4005-58894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58894\">Bor</a> and <a href=\"/buri/4005-29073/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29073\">Buri</a> can also wield Mjolnir. The cyborg clone of Thor known as <a href=\"/ragnarok/4005-47573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47573\">Ragnarok</a> was also able to pick up an alternate universe version of Mjolnir when he and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts </a>traveled to another universe.</p><p>The ability to wield Mjolnir is not permanent, and may also depend on need. For example, when Thor became Lord of Asgard for a time, he was temporarily unable to pick up Mjolnir for having strayed from his honorable path.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>As the inscription states, Mjolnir grants its users \"the power of Thor.\" The most prominent of these powers are flight, shown to reach speeds far in excess of the speed of light, and electrical discharge, often demonstrated by either blasts of lightning or by calling it from the sky. Mjolnir possesses a fraction of the Odin Force, more powerful than the Power Cosmic given to Heralds of Galactus. This weapon has more exotic abilities such as energy absorption and projection, dimensional transportation, the creation of force fields, and the tracking of any being or object to anywhere in time or space. But Thor has rarely called on it to perform in such a fashion. The most powerful attack Mjolnir is capable of channeling is the God-blast (which draws power from Thor's life force, and is an ability inherent only to Thor). This is possible without Mjolnir, but it is less concentrated on a single target. Another powerful attack is the Anti-Force which was said to be able to decimate entire planets in a single blast.</p><h2>Alternate Universes</h2><p>Those who have been deemed worthy to wield Mjolnir in Alternate Realities are:</p><p>Adam Warlock, Earth-19141</p><p><a href=\"/alex-power/4005-21198/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21198\">Alex Power</a>, Earth-5631</p><p>Beta Ray Bill, multiple realities</p><p><a href=\"/conan/4005-2438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2438\">Conan the Barbarian</a>, Earth-83600</p><p><a href=\"/crusader/4005-47662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47662\">Crusader</a>, Earth-9811</p><p>Danielle Cage, Earth-807128</p><p>Dazzler, Earth-15513</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/dargo/4005-15990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15990\">Dargo Ktor</a>, Earth-8710</p><p>Deadpool</p><p><a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>,</p><p><a href=\"/magni-thorson/4005-58501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58501\">Magni</a>,</p><p><a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a>,</p><p> </p><p>Throg</p><p>Vision</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC</a>'s <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> have also been portrayed as being able to lift Mjolnir in non-canon inter-company <a href=\"/crossover/4015-55803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55803\">crossovers</a>.</p><h3>Ultimate Mjolnir</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52246/1593864-thor_178.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1593864\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55874316939891\" data-width=\"732\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 732px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52246/1593864-thor_178.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1593864\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Mjolnir design.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/52246/1593864-thor_178.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/52246/1593864-thor_178.jpg 732w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/52246/1593864-thor_178.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Ultimate Mjolnir design.</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimate Thor's hammer bears little resemblance to its 616 counterpart.

The dwarves had a champion, and Eitri demanded Odin send a woman to defeat the champion. If the woman bested the champion, the dwarves would forge the hammer. If the champion won, the female would become the champion's chattel. Odin chose <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\">Sif</a> for this battle and she bested the Throgg the Dwarf. Sif then learned that Throgg had ruled the dwarves with his freakish size, and that having been defeated by a woman he would never show his face again. The Dwarves gained their freedom, and a tale to tell for ages to come. Thus Eitri fulfilled his bargain and forged Stormbreaker.</p><p> </p><h2>Properties</h2><p>As Stormbreaker is an enchanted weapon of Asgard similar to Thor's hammer Mjolnir, it has unique properties and attributes. It is an extremely powerful weapon.</p><ul><li><strong>Elemental Control</strong>: the ability to summon and create storms, lightning blasts, intense gale force winds, and rain.</li><li><strong>Energy Projection</strong>: aside from lightning, there are powerful concussive type blasts as well composed of some type of mystical energy</li><li><strong>Flight</strong>: Stormbreaker allows Beta Ray Bill flight, including into the depths of space. Also has exhibited Faster Than Light high end travel speeds.</li><li><strong>Striking Power</strong>: incredibly strong striking blunt force trauma blows</li><li><strong>Teleportation</strong>: the ability to transport interdimensionally (such as to Asgard) or to teleport objects (such as when teleported a comet into Ego the living planet)</li><li><strong>Return to Sender</strong>: the hammer returns to Beta Ray Bill's hand after being thrown such as Mjolnir does to Thor. It is also able to be summoned to Bill if out of his hands without being thrown.</li><li><strong>Worthiness</strong>: Similar to Mjolnir, only those who are worthy may lift and wield Stormbreaker. To dat the only beings capable of accomplishing this are Odin, Beta Ray Bill, and Eric Masterson Thor.</li></ul><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117571/4587152-24dhssg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4587152\" data-ratio=\"0.43222222222222\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:43.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117571/4587152-24dhssg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4587152\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117571/4587152-24dhssg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117571/4587152-24dhssg.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117571/4587152-24dhssg.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-23893/","id":23893,"name":"Something Old, Something New...","issue_number":"339"},"id":40972,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/125906-67533-stormbreaker.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Stormbreaker"},"name":"Stormbreaker","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/stormbreaker/4055-40972/","start_year":"1984"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-40973/","count_of_issue_appearances":85,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2014-08-15 10:14:56","deck":"Thunderstrike is the enchanted mace made for Eric Masterson.

Collecting and using all six gems will give the wielder complete control over the universe.","description":"<h2>Characteristics of the Infinity Gems</h2><p>Initially known as the Soul Gems, and also known as the Reality Gems, the Infinity Gems are among the most powerful artifacts in existence. The unassuming gems are oblong in shape and smooth in texture. They are about 4 to 5 inches in length. The power in these gems are subtle in their influence, and if an owner is unaware of the vast potential of a gem they could very well never realize it. Each gem gives the bearer complete power and mastery over it's aspect of the universe which are Power, Reality, Space, Time, Mind, and Soul. Together the gems give whomever can combine their control over all aspects, making the wielder immensely powerful to the point of omnipotence. The gems can be mounted on the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, a golden left glove.</p><p>Only the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">Living Tribunal</a>, judge of the multiverse, is immune to the wishes of the wielder of the Infinity Gems.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Largely unknown to all but a few select beings is the origin of the gems. After discovering the true potential of the gems <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> told the history of the gems to the Elder of the Universe, The <a href=\"/runner/4005-41661/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41661\">Runner</a>. The gems are the remains of a once omnipotent being named <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-68699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68699\">Nemesis</a> whose domain was any and all realities. This great being was also utterly alone. This being attempted to create life forms, but the life forms lacked the concept of good or evil, and devolved into demonic beasts. Realizing its error the being destroyed its flawed creations. Once again alone and unable to bear the eternal solitude, the being committed suicide.</p><p>However, power at that level does not easily dissipate, and remnants of that being forged into the Infinity Gems. The gems have been found to have their own sentience, and they are all linked to one another. The most recent discovery has been that possession of these gems can allow the owner to 'find' the other gems. Though it's also been discovered that securing the first five gems consecutively becomes more difficult to obtain, though eventual ownership of five gems would give the owner enough power to lure or locate the last. This makes possession of all six next to impossible.</p><h2>The Infinity Gems</h2><p>Originally known as the soul gems, they were renamed the Infinity Gems by Thanos. He also gave each individual gem a name based on the power they possessed.</p><p>The Infinity Gems are:</p><p><b><a href=\"/soul-gem/4055-55645/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55645\">SOUL</a> -</b> This green gem is the first to be seen in continuity in the Power of Warlock series. It is arguably the most dangerous. Its sentience is the most profound, and it has shown a hunger for souls, a hunger that can possess a novice user. This gem allows the user to steal, manipulate and alter souls, living or dead. Within the gem are collected souls in perpetual limbo. Mastery of the gem would allow the user to control all living life in the universe. The gem also allows the bearer access to an idyllic pocket-universe that is much like heaven.</p><p>Notable Owners: <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a>, the <a href=\"/in-betweener/4005-13354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13354\">In-Betweener</a>, Thanos, <a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> (Earth-9997/Earth-X)</p><p><b><a href=\"/power-gem/4055-55644/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55644\">POWER</a> -</b> This red gem contains access to all power and energy that ever has or will exist. Mastery of the gem would allow the user to duplicate any physical superhuman ability. They would be essentially physically invincible and therefore unbeatable when using raw power alone. It can also be use as an unlimited power supply for any machine. When combined, this gem can boost the effects of other gems, allowing the user to tap into a gems potential without necessarily mastering it.</p><p>Note: The color of the gem has fluctuated. When it was in the possession of <a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4005-6807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6807\">Drax The Destroyer</a> the Power Gem was noted as pink. It also appeared blue when in the possession of Thor. Whether this is intentional or not is still questionable, but for the most part the gem is red.</p><p>Notable Owners: <a href=\"/champion/4005-26081/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26081\">Champion</a>, Thanos, Magus, Drax, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic,</a> <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a></p><p><b><a href=\"/time-gem/4055-57126/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57126\">TIME</a> -</b> This orange gem allows the user to be in any period of time. From the beginning to the end of time, any moment is accessible or visible through its power. Those with limited knowledge in the use of the gem can cause those nearby to revert to a physically older or younger state. With enough knowledge, even more can be done, as time and causality can be manipulated with this gem. The user can also use time as a weapon, trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. Mastery would allow the user to affect the whole universe with time manipulation, such as slowing down time in one stretch of the cosmos, freezing time in another and looping time in yet another.</p><p>Notable Owners: <a href=\"/gardener/4005-15937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15937\">Gardener</a>, Thanos, Magus, <a href=\"/gamora/4005-6806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6806\">Gamora</a>, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, <a href=\"/steve-rogers-super-soldier/4050-34244/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-34244\">Steve Rogers</a></p><p><b><a href=\"/space-gem/4055-57127/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57127\">SPACE</a> -</b> This purple gem allows its owner to be anywhere in an instant. They can be in multiple places in the universe, or nowhere. Mastery would allow the owner to warp or rearrange space as they see fit.</p><p>Notable Owners: <a href=\"/runner/4005-41661/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41661\">Runner</a>, Thanos, <a href=\"/pip/4005-13782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13782\">Pip</a> the Troll, <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a></p><p><b><a href=\"/mind-gem/4055-57129/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57129\">MIND</a> -</b> The blue mind gem gives the owner access to all thoughts and dreams. It also gives the user a wide number of other mentally related abilities including telekinesis. It encompasses the collective consciousness of the universe. In the hands of one unskilled in its use, the gem could unleash your dreams and nightmares uncontrollably within your mind. Worse yet, one oblivious to the dangers can have their inner demons overwhelm them. For a novice user it can add or boost mental power, and augment the mind's abilities. Further knowledge of the gem can allow the user to tap into further power. Where the reality gem alters reality itself, the Mind gem can make you think the world has changed. Mastery would allow the user to access all the minds of the universe, simultaneously.</p><p>Notable Owners: <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\">Grandmaster</a>, Thanos, Magus, <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a>, <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a></p><p><b><a href=\"/reality-gem/4055-57128/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57128\">REALITY</a> -</b> They say that perception is reality. The yellow Infinity gem makes that quite literally true. Perhaps the most powerful of the gems, mastery can render scientific laws meaningless, senses useless. With this gem wishes can be obtained. The vastness of its power can overwhelm its user, making a novice cease to exist. This gem is perhaps even more dangerous by itself than with the the help of another gem to manage its power. It is the most difficult to control and utilize.</p><p>Notable Owners: <a href=\"/collector/4005-13987/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13987\">Collector</a>, Thanos, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man,</a> <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a></p><h2>Infinite Destinies</h2><p>To keep the stones from falling into the wrong hands again, Adam Warlock imbued them with a sense of purpose so they would develop sentience and choose their own users.</p><p>Reality Gem - <a href=\"/star/4005-157233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-157233\">Star</a>, a reporter who got famous off an anti-<a href=\"/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a> article</p><p>Time Gem - <a href=\"/overtime/4005-153930/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-153930\">Overtime</a>, a convict who used his gem to escape prison.</p><p>Power Gem - <a href=\"/prince-of-power/4005-163212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-163212\">Prince of Power</a>, an alien who fell in with the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></p><p>Space Gem - <a href=\"/quantum/4005-169879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-169879\">Quantum</a>, hired muscle for an artificial intelligence</p><p>Soul Gem - <a href=\"/multitude/4005-171818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-171818\">Multitude</a>, a synthetic person studying humanity</p><p>Mind Gem - Still unrevealed</p><h2>The Worlds Within</h2><p>Each of the gems have hidden pocket worlds inside each of them</p><p>Mind Gem - <a href=\"/mindscape/4020-53468/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-53468\">The Mindscape</a></p><p>Soul Gem - <a href=\"/soulworld/4020-64335/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-64335\">Soul World</a></p><p>Power Gem - <a href=\"/the-arena/4020-66135/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-66135\">The Arena</a></p><p>Space Gem - <a href=\"/the-vast/4020-66136/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-66136\">The Vast</a></p><p>Time Gem - <a href=\"/the-ellipsis/4020-66137/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-66137\">The Ellipsis</a></p><p>Reality Gem - <a href=\"/the-world-pool/4020-66138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-66138\">The World Pool</a></p><h2>The Seventh Gem</h2><p>Often ignored, best forgotten, the seventh gem was created for a Marvel/Ultraverse crossover. The seventh gem, Ego, was discovered by <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>. It was found that <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-68699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68699\">Nemesis</a>, an omnipotent being in the Ultraverse, was the source of the Infinity Gems and that the seventh gem was her remaining consciousness. When combined, this gem would give the other gems form and sentience.

He learned of them from an Inhuman long thought dead who was imprisoned with him on Ryker's Island.

Their first attempt at a galactic police force, the <a href=\"../../the-manhunters/65-55857/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Manhunters</a>, was a failure, due to their lack of sentient emotion.</p><p>The Guardians turned to sentient beings from across the universe, and thus created the <a href=\"../../green-lantern-corps/6992/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Green Lantern Corps</a>. The Guardians forged rings, which channeled pure willpower from their users into solid constructs and objects. The rings were powered by the <a href=\"../../central-power-battery/18-55704/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Central Power Battery</a>, another object the Guardians created.</p><h2>Alan Scott's Ring</h2><p>The Guardians of the Universe gathered all random magic and fused it into the <a href=\"../../starheart/18-47348/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Starheart</a>, which gained sentience. A piece of the Starheart fell to <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>. It was fashioned into a rail road lantern which, during a train disaster, saved <a href=\"../../alan-scott/29-12663/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alan Scott</a> of Earth. Creating a ring from part of the lantern, Scott fought crime as the \"Green Lantern.\"</p><p>Alan Scott's <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">power ring</a> has many capabilities. It creates anything the wearer can imagine and it gives the wearer the ability to fly, but it's magic cannot affect wood and things related to wood, like cellulose particles. The ring must be recharged every 24 hours by touching the <a href=\"../../green-lantern/12-41148/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Green Lantern</a> for 10 seconds.</p><h2>Original Corps Rings</h2><p>Deciding to form a galactic peacekeeping corps, the Guardians forged a giant, main Central Power Battery on planet <a href=\"../../oa/34-41360/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Oa</a>, combining their own energy with the planet's ambient power. They chose 3600 agents and gave each a ring, a personal power battery linked to the Central Power Battery, and a sector of space to protect. A Corps member could select his own successor, as <a href=\"../../abin-sur/29-22634/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Abin Sur</a> did with his test pilot <a href=\"../../hal-jordan/29-11202/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hal Jordan</a>.</p><p>These rings, just as <a href=\"../../alan-scott/29-12663/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alan Scott</a> 's, create/do anything the wearer can imagine, but this time their powers included time travel, and they also allow the wearer to fly. The ring's potency depends on the willpower of the wearer. The rings can also create duplicates of themselves. Reserve power automatically protects the wearer from mortal harm. The ring must be charged every 24 hours by touching the battery for 10 seconds, during which time the Green Lantern will usually recite their oath, and it's energy cannot affect anything colored yellow.</p><h2>Oan Power Rings</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24019/1069329-oan_power_ring.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1069329\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"140\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 140px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24019/1069329-oan_power_ring.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1069329\"><img alt=\"A Guardian's Oan power ring\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/24019/1069329-oan_power_ring.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/24019/1069329-oan_power_ring.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" data-width=\"140\"></a><figcaption>A Guardian's Oan power ring</figcaption></figure><p>In the days before the original Green Lantern Corps, the Guardian known as <a href=\"../../meadlux/29-49713/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Meadlux</a> created a power ring specifically for the Guardians. An Oan power ring possessed the same capabilities as a standard ring, but was fueled by the internal power of its wielder and thus did not need to be recharged. Unlike the traditional Green Lantern power ring, an Oan power ring did not contain the impurity that restricted its capabilities against materials colored yellow. The revelation that such a weapon existed caused a great schism within the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps. Officers who had lost close comrades due to adversaries empowered by yellow weaponry lost faith in the Guardians, some of whom, such as <a href=\"../../galius-zed/29-46824/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Galius Zed</a>, <a href=\"../../eddore/29-50693/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Eddore</a>, and <a href=\"../../kaylark/29-49731/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kaylark</a> even went so far as to turn their backs on the Guardians, coveting the rings for themselves. Another group of individuals who took an interest in the Oan power rings were the space pirates known as the Free Lancers.</p><h2>Power Ring's Power Ring</h2><p><a href=\"../../power-ring/29-4702/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Power Ring</a>, a member of the <a href=\"../../crime-syndicate-of-amerika/65-41531/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Crime Syndicate of America</a>, wielded a Power Ring that utilized mystic energy, enabling him to fight and sometimes overcome even the Crime Syndicate of America's counterpart to <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"/ultraman/4005-5692/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5692\">Ultraman</a>. Its powers were the same as Hal's, but without the yellow weakness, or Alan's wood weakness.</p><h2>Kyle Rayner's Ring</h2><p>After <a href=\"../../green-lantern/29-45112/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Green Lantern</a> Hal Jordan went rogue - destroying the Corps, the Guardians, and the Main Battery - the sole remaining Guardian, <a href=\"../../ganthet/29-6951/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ganthet</a>, gathered the fragments of Hal's shattered ring. He created from them the last Power Ring and conferred it upon a young Earth man, <a href=\"../../kyle-rayner/29-40431/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kyle Rayner</a>. Kyle's battery is a piece of the original Main Power Battery.</p><p>Just as the rings before him, Kyle Rayner's ring creates anything the wearer can imagine and allows the wearer to fly. This special ring though is keyed to Kyle Rayner's DNA. It can only be used by him, those related to him, and Hal Jordan. The power supply is expended according to what the ring creates rather than the length of time since it's last recharge. The ring must be recharged by touching to the battery for a period proportionately equal to how \"empty\" it is. It gives the wearer a sense of \"full\" or \"empty.\" Rayner's power ring is invulnerable to every known substance.</p><h2>Sojourner Mullein's Ring</h2><p>Jo's ring does everything a regular Green Lantern ring does, however, it does not need a power battery to recharge. Instead, it recharges incrementally over time. A side effect is if it ever depletes completely, it takes a lot longer for it to be useful, leaving the ringbearer vulnerable for longer. It has also been specifically designed to not power itself based on the will to overcome fear but rather the will to live with it. According to the Guardian that gave it to her, this causes more random spikes in sheer power. To save on power, she has an implant with a translator program called \"Meatware\" so she can understand the people of The City Enduring instead of using the ring's universal translator. </p><h2>New Corps Rings</h2><p>The new, reformed <a href=\"../../sinestro-corps-predator/29-57104/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Corps</a> has new rings. With the destruction of the cosmic entity of fear, <a href=\"../../parallax/29-41293/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Parallax</a>, came a new age for the Green Lantern Corps. Kyle Rayner single-handedly reformed the corps.</p><p>Also with the destruction of <a href=\"../../parallax/29-41293/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Parallax</a> came the removal of the \"yellow impurity,\" as it is now called, and only new Green Lanterns have trouble with the color yellow. They must feel fear, and overcome it, before they can effect the color yellow. Other than this, the new rings are almost exactly like the original Corps' rings.</p><h2>Other Power Rings</h2><p>The <a href=\"../../the-book-of-oa/18-56006/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Book of Oa</a> has a forbidden chapter on cosmic revelations, which included prophecies about the <a href=\"../../the-blackest-night/39-55766/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Blackest Night</a>. At the end of the <a href=\"../../sinestro-corps-war/39-50650/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sinestro Corps War</a>, the Guardians of the Universe known as Ganthet and <a href=\"../../sayd/29-45697/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sayd</a> reveal to the four Green Lanterns based on Earth the final verse of the prophecy, known as the \"Blackest Night\", which reveals that five more Corps, one for each of the remaining colors of the rainbow will be created in the future and that war will break out between the seven Corps until they destroy each other and the universe, leading to the Blackest Night prophesy.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"../../sinestro-corps-ring/18-53415/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Yellow</a></b> Unlike the Green Rings of the Corps which operate by channeling pure willpower, these rings which are forged on <a href=\"../../qward/34-41619/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Qward</a> channel pure fear. Several versions of these rings have been created, but recently they have become the primary weapon of the <a href=\"../../sinestro-corps/65-42352/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sinestro Corps</a>, seeking out individuals to battle the Green Lantern Corps who have the ability to instill great fear.</li><li><b><a href=\"../../blue-power-ring/18-55735/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Blue</a></b> Blue Power Rings are shown to symbolize hope, and were forged by Ganthet and Sayd, two former guardians. <a href=\"../../blue-lantern-corps/65-50163/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Blue Lantern Corps'</a> rings only work when an active green lantern is present.</li><li><b><a href=\"../../red-power-ring/18-55723/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Red</a></b> Red rings channel rage and hate.

The size, complexity, and strength of these constructs is limited only by the ring-bearer's willpower; whatever the wearer imagines, the ring will create.</p><p>When active, a power ring will encase its user in a protective, life-supporting force field. This force field allows the user to fly, travel through inhospitable environments (outer space, underwater, etc.), and enter hyperspace in order to move vast distances quickly. The ring also generates its wearer's Green Lantern uniform: the uniform appears over their normal attire and vanishes at the user's will.The uniform varies from Lantern to Lantern, based on anatomy, personal preference, and the social norms of their race. The only rule in this regard seems to be that the uniform must openly display the symbol of the corps, though even this has been modified based on preference, (a vampire-hunting Lantern adapts the symbol into a cross, and a blind Lantern with no concept of light or color uses the image of a bell) as in the case of Kyle Rayner who wears a modified version of the symbol on his uniform.</p><p>Power rings also appear to be highly advanced computers; they are able to talk to and advise the wearer as to various courses of action, as well as act as a universal translator. The ring can also scan for energy signatures or particular objects. For more intricate problems or problems that require a back logged history (Of a planet, person, group, etc), the ring connects with the main power battery on Oa which is the \"main\" computer, of sorts.</p><p>Power rings are able to give off electromagnetic radiation of various frequencies. This radiation can be focused by the wearer into a beam, similar in appearance and effect to a powerful laser. The ring is also capable of producing an electrical current. Less frequently used capabilities include splitting atomic nuclei and manipulating subatomic particles (thereby transmuting chemical elements). A power ring is also capable of creating fully functional duplicates of itself.</p><p>While power rings have to be worn to be effective, at several points Green Lanterns have shown the ability to summon the ring to them from a distance (even if someone else is wearing it) or order it to carry out commands automatically after being removed. Some power rings have been shown to be genetically keyed to the wearer, like Kyle Rayner's, though villains have circumvented this through various means. For instance, Manhunters use tissue samples to make Kyle's ring think it is still on his hand. When a Green Lantern is slain, their ring will automatically seek out a suitable replacement after logging the death for record. While the Green Lantern ring is an extremely advanced computer and is highly intelligent, it cannot think for itself. The ring will only act if it is given instructions by its wearer. Also, when a wearer expires, it will seek out a new replacement, but at that point, Mogo, the planet sized Green Lantern takes over telepathic \"custody\" of the ring and issues its commands helping it find a suitable new recruit. Without Mogo, the ring would just transport itself to Oa and fall to the ground inert until it is needed again.</p><p>The Ring is a source of limitless power, and thus there is no limit to what it can do, but here are some abilities it has been shown to have.</p><h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3><p>Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.</p><h3>Universal Translator</h3><p>The ring is programmed with every language in the universe, and translates all alien languages into the language thee wielder speaks. This helps eliminate the language barrier and facilitate communication between lanterns.</p><h3>Invulnerability</h3><p>Every lantern is protected by an invisible force field that eliminates waste, provides a breathable atmosphere for the wielder in any environment(underwater, space, etc.) and protects the wielder from all forms of harm(radiation, bullets, etc.).</p><h3>Flight</h3><p>Via manipulation of gravitons, lanterns can hover or fly in any direction. In space, they can fly at faster than light speeds.</p><h3>Wormhole Creation</h3><p>Rings create wormholes to allow lanterns to travel between the stars in a short amount of time.</p><h3>Willpower Constructs</h3><p>A lantern can create anything he or she imagines, assuming they have enough willpower to do it. The objects created by a green lantern are not indestructible, and the strength of the constructs depends on the focus and willpower put forth by the wielder. If the wearer's willpower is weak, then their constructs will be weak as well. Depending on the amount of focus and willpower from the wearer, the ring can be the wearer's greatest asset or greatest detriment.</p><h3>Ring Duplication</h3><p>Each ring can duplicate itself, creating a second ring which may be given to another as a backup, for protection, or to help the lantern in times of great need. This duplicate ring is exactly like a normal ring.</p><h2>Retconned</h2><h3>Radiation</h3><p>Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a href=\"../../kryptonite/18-32213/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kryptonite</a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Superman</a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.</p><h3>Time travel</h3><p>The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><h3>Mental Incapacitation</h3><p>The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.</p><h3>Yellow Impurity</h3><p>In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps/4060-42352/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\">Sinestro Corps</a> as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to overcome great fear.</p><h3>Recharge</h3><p>Previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring to it.

The lasso also seems to be able to increase in length to an unknown degree, depending on the situation. Throughout the years, different artist have depicted the lasso as a simple piece of rope to a fiery, glowing rope which emphasizes the amount of power the lasso can unleash. the lasso also has the quality that any device caught in it maintains its structural integrity despite the pressure of having a a piece of rope wrapped around something. In this way Wonder Woman has been able to hold a submarine, a skyscraper and even the planet Earth in her grasp without those objects breaking. There are only three ways to escape from the lasso, either the bearer releases it, the captured individual dies, or a god or other divine entity releases it. In line with the first method is it possible still to attack the person holding the lasso and force them to release it in this way.</p><p>There is a fair amount of precedent that any statement made in the presence of the lasso is inadmissible in court as it is brought forth by coercion.

There were many prototypes that had been in development at the time, however in 1941, the first \"Batmobile\" was introduced. It was a red convertible that was based on a 1936 Ford. The traditional Batmobile usually sported a Bat Head on the grill, this version did not. This was the one and only of that era that did not sport the emblem on the hood. The 40's saw a few incarnations based on the cars of the time which were usually very curvy and long.</p><p>The 1950's saw similar Batmobile's fashioned like the ones in the 40's. The 50's, however, did introduce a very iconic piece to the car, the bubble dome. This dome would cover both the passenger and driver side seats. The 40's curves however soon began to disappear. Also, the fans in the 50's did not like the fact the the Batmobile appeared to be very simplistic and criticized it. The 1950's featured the removal of the famous on-board laboratory that was heavily used before. The 50's models were used until the early 1960's where subtle changes were added. It wasn't until 1969 that there would be another major change to the iconic vehicle.</p><p>In 1969 there were major changes not only for the car, but for Batman himself, including Grayson going to college and moving to the heart of Gotham. The Batmobile changed from a larger-than-life vehicle to a vehicle that became more idealistic. The car was now a coupe with turbo-charged engines. It also features bullet-proof protection on and around the vehicle, including the windows, hydraulic shocks and diplomatic plates. Another addition was the remote guidance system that could serve as a distraction for the Caped Crusader to get out of tight situations.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-264441\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11326/264441-172761-batmobile.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11326/264441-172761-batmobile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-264441\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11326/264441-172761-batmobile.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11326/264441-172761-batmobile.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-width=\"360\"></a></figure><p>The 1970's based the vehicle on some of the major sports car look. A significant look was featured in <em><a href=\"/detective-comics-449-midnight-rustler-of-gotham-ci/4000-112751/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-112751\">Detective Comics #449</a></em>. It was a full-sized car that had more armor and had the ability to sustain high-impact collisions.</p><p>The 1980's saw more additions/changes to the car. In 1988, Batman was brainwashed, but later saved by <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Robin</a> and forced to flee for a time. When they returned, they did so with a new Batmobile. This version resembled the one used in <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller's</a> <em><a href=\"/the-dark-knight-returns/4045-55703/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55703\">The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>. It was a huge vehicle that sported 15-inch balloon tires that were puncture proof. It had advanced radar and a machine gun that was outfitted with tranquilizers that fires 200 rounds per minute (RPM). This car would show up again in the late 90's, 10 years after its initial use.</p><p>The 1990's continued the trend of the car's history. It did however, feature a departure. When Bruce Wayne's back was broken, <a href=\"/jean-paul-valley/4005-12834/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12834\">Jean-Paul Valley</a> was given the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mantle/4015-55784/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55784\">mantle</a> of the Bat.

This need was fulfilled by a new type of Batmobile with all-terrain capability.

The Batmobile has two seats available at the backpart of it.</p><h3>Merchandise</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3948602-bat.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3948602\" data-ratio=\"0.90546528803545\" data-width=\"677\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 677px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3948602-bat.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3948602\"><img alt=\"A Batmobile by Mattel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3948602-bat.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/3948602-bat.png 677w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3948602-bat.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3948602-bat.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Batmobile by Mattel\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3948602-bat.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/3948602-bat.png 677w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3948602-bat.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3948602-bat.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Batmobile by Mattel</figcaption></figure><p>Toys of the Batmobile are extremely common to come by.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-112062/","id":112062,"name":"The Return of Doctor Death","issue_number":"30"},"id":41463,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14487/7791881-5c06c4f8-a8c4-4522-8b0d-2a747c9715df.jpeg","image_tags":"All Images,Batmobile (Comics)"},"name":"Batmobile","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batmobile/4055-41463/","start_year":"1939"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41472/","count_of_issue_appearances":444,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2017-07-26 11:07:42","deck":"In the DC Universe, a boom tube is an interstellar portal used by residents of New Genesis and Apokolips.","description":"<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/384691-46443-boom-tube.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384691\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/384691-46443-boom-tube.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384691\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/384691-46443-boom-tube.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/384691-46443-boom-tube.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure><p>A boom tube needs to be created by an external device, such as a <a href=\"../../mother-box/18-41473/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mother Box</a>.

They were invented by the <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokoliptian</a> scientist <a href=\"/himon/4005-12102/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12102\">Himon the Artificer</a> using the mysterious <a href=\"/element-x/4055-55896/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55896\">Element X</a>. They have vast undefined abilities which range from teleportation via <a href=\"/boom-tube/4055-41472/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41472\">Boom Tubes</a>, to energy manipulation. Each Mother Box is sentient and provides its user with unconditional love. They get their name from the fact that they act as caretakers to their users, and provide them with love, in a sense becoming a mother to them.</p><p>Mother Boxes can only be manufactured by a being of the Fourth World, and not all such beings can do so. It is implied that the character of the maker influences the successful creation of a mother box, and that each Box has a fragment of the builder's personality encoded within. <a href=\"/metron/4005-3616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3616\">Metron</a> stated that each mother box shares a mystical rapport with nature, and that they have a direct link to the <a href=\"/the-source/4015-48870/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-48870\">Source</a>, from which they draw their power. So, in a way, a Mother Box is best described as a computer link to god.</p><p>Mother Boxes are generally shaped as a box, although this form is not necessary. <a href=\"/mr-miracle/4005-5703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5703\">Mister Miracle</a> had his Mother Box circuitry woven into his suit. They communicate through repetitive pings, which can be understood by their user. They have been known to self-destruct after their user dies although this is not always the case.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Each Mother box can access the energy to perform a vast variety of abilities. To date, mother boxes have shown capable of:</p><ul><li>Summoning Boom Tubes</li><li>Matter transmutation</li><li>Energy manipulation</li><li>Force Field creation</li><li>Healing</li><li>Gravity control</li><li>Levitation</li><li>Emotion Control</li><li>Illusion casting</li><li>Technopathy</li><li>Fire manipulation</li><li>Phasing</li><li>Telekinesis</li><li>Dimensional manipulation</li><li>Teleportation/portal creation</li></ul><p>They appear to have a vast, possibly unlimited variety of abilities, but are generally limited in range to the user's personal space.</p><h2>Notable Mother Boxes</h2><p>Among the most famous Mother Boxes is the one possessed by <a href=\"/mr-miracle/4005-5703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5703\">Mister Miracle</a>, who had its circuitry woven into the circuitry of his suit. <a href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\">Orion</a> was also given a mother box by <a href=\"/mortalla/4005-21177/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21177\">Mortalla</a>, wife of <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>, in hopes of using the Box's circuitry to turn him in favor of Darkseid; he used this box to keep his emotions, bestial rage, and appearance in check. This box was lent to <a href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Oracle</a> during the <a href=\"/mageddon/4005-11277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11277\">Mageddon</a> crisis. The Mother Box of the <a href=\"/forever-people/4060-25939/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25939\">Forever People</a> was also notable, which they use to summon <a href=\"/infinity-man/4005-27485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27485\">Infinity Man</a>.</p><p>A Mother Box was given to <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> in <a href=\"/jla-avengers/4050-10941/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-10941\">JLA/Avengers</a> by Metron. He used it to predict JLA 's movements, and it interfaced with his suit. A mother Box was used by <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-2350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2350\">Captain Marvel</a> to access his lightning when <a href=\"/shazam/4005-2365/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2365\">Shazam</a> was on <a href=\"/new-genesis/4020-41471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41471\">New Genesis</a>. <a href=\"/shilo-norman/4005-36605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36605\">Shilo Norman</a> possessed the last remaining Mother Box—sometimes referred to as a \"Motherboxxx\"—to survive the war and destruction of Apokolips and <a href=\"/new-genesis/4020-41471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41471\">New Genesis</a>. Another Mother Box was lent to <a href=\"/jack-knight/4005-23783/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23783\">Jack Knight</a> in his quest to reach <a href=\"/throneworld/4020-55873/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55873\">Throneworld</a>, and the memories and personality of his father, <a href=\"/ted-knight/4005-9296/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9296\">Ted Knight</a>, were encoded as the Mother Box's artificial intelligence. It discussed was progress with <a href=\"/seyg-el/4005-69646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69646\">Seyg-El</a>, grandfather of Superman, and counseled Jack in his quests to the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Superheroes'</a> time and to <a href=\"/rann/4020-55709/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55709\">Rann</a>.</p><p>A lone <a href=\"/parademon/4005-9998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9998\">Parademon,</a> who had looted no less than ten mother boxes from citizens of New Genesis he had killed, demonstrated a degree of free will unknown to other <a href=\"/parademons/4060-57182/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57182\">parademons</a>. It is unclear, however, if this Parademon achieved his freedom due to his exposure to the Mother Boxes or if it was a normal part of his personality. He escaped to Earth and eventually joined with the <a href=\"/secret-six/4060-38149/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-38149\">Secret Six</a>. Although his captive Mother Boxes would not allow him to open Boom Tubes, they did choose to help the Parademon in some aspects, and agreed to self-destruct in order to defend his teammates with a suicide charge in his final moments.</p><p>In DC's <a href=\"/future-state/4045-60715/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-60715\">Future State</a>, a Mother Box was located in the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone</a>. <a href=\"/cyborg-superman/4005-12926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12926\">Cyborg Superman</a> knew about it and led the <a href=\"/house-of-el/4060-59562/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59562\">House of El</a> there, under the guise that it would help them escape the Phantom Zone. When the group found it and used it to open up a portal, Cyborg Superman attempted to steal it for himself but the Els stopped him and used it to return home.</p><h3>Variants</h3><h4>Father Box</h4><p><a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokoliptian</a> versions of Mother Boxes also exist and are known as <a href=\"/father-box/4055-56373/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56373\">Father Boxes</a>. These boxes communicate with a \"ting!\" sound instead of a \"ping!\" sound, and summon \"Hush Tubes\" instead of Boom Tubes.</p><h4>Grandmother Box</h4><p>In an alternate future of <i><a href=\"/jla-rock-of-ages/4050-44188/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-44188\">JLA: Rock of Ages</a></i>, <a href=\"/granny-goodness/4005-3629/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3629\">Granny Goodness</a> at one point invaded the central computer on New Genesis and somehow got fused with it, becoming an insane Grandmother box. It is destroyed in a suicide attack by <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>. It attacked with \"firepit\" blasts and teleportational abilities.</p><h4>Ancestor Box</h4><p>After striking Batman with the <a href=\"/omega-effect/4015-48937/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-48937\">Omega Effect</a>, Darkseid used a Mother Box-esque device called an Ancestor Box. Within this box seems to be some sort of hyperdimensional creature Darkseid refers to as a \"Hyper-Adapter\". This box seems to be able to warp time and space, accounting for Batman's travels through time during the <a href=\"/batman-return-of-bruce-wayne/4045-56130/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56130\">Return of Bruce Wayne</a>. The Hyper-Adapter may have some connection to the Hyper Fauna fought by Batman in the aforementioned return, or the sentient Omega fought by Shiloh Norman.</p><h4>Orphan Box</h4><p>Upon the destruction of the android known as <a href=\"/gonzo/4005-56925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56925\">Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard</a>, <a href=\"/father-time/4005-35901/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35901\">Father Time</a> converted its body into an \"orphan box\" in the shape of glasses, to be wielded against the Mathemagicians of the <a href=\"/anti-life-equation/4015-42524/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42524\">Anti-Life Equation</a>.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-11260/","id":11260,"name":"Orion Fights for Earth!","issue_number":"1"},"id":41473,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/18154/1366447-mother_box_002.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Mother Box"},"name":"Mother Box","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mother-box/4055-41473/","start_year":"1971"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41533/","count_of_issue_appearances":131,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2015-10-03 11:57:15","deck":"A jewel of power created by the mystical entity Cyttorak, Lord of the Crimson Cosmos.

Those given the Sigil are advanced high up the evolutionary ladder.","description":"<br /><p><br /><a href=\"/\"></a></p><p>Creation of the Sigils</p><p>==========================</p> The Sigils are a unifying feature in the Bright Universe (Sigilverse). When they were originally conceived, it appeared that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42966\" href=\"/danik/4005-42966/\">Danik</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42974\" href=\"/solusandra/4005-42974/\">Solusandra</a> were either at odds with one another, or two capricious gods playing a chilling game with the universe. On Solusandra's part, the bestowing of Sigils was meant to cause the conflict necessary to reignite and generate the much needed universal forces necessary to fuel her god-like powers. We later learn that the Sigil-bearers are actually an army that has been raised up to work in conjunction with the First in the coming battle against the forces of the Negation Universe and their evil god, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13218\" href=\"/charon/4005-13218/\">Charon</a>.<p>After Solusandra creates and bestows her Sigils (pictured above), she is cast down and seemingly destroyed by her fellow ascended Atlanteans (excepting Danik). During their cataclysmic battle, a rift is torn in the barrier between the Bright and Dark universes, and the energies of Charon and Solusandra intermingle with explosive results, destroying all remaining ascended Atlanteans except for Danik.</p> Danik visits the planet to which Solusandra fell and briefly mourns her death. He then leaves, breaking himself apart into many different splinter aspects, or avatars, who venture throughout the universe to watch over and mentor each of Solusandra's Sigil-bearers. Some of these aspects of Danik already existed, and had for some time, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13250\" href=\"/enson/4005-13250/\">Enson</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13254\" href=\"/wyture/4005-13254/\">Wyture</a> of the first. When Danik leaves, he fails to see Solusandra's energies revitalizing the barren planet on which she fell. Unknown to her fellow god, Solusandra saved herself by splitting her essence and memories between the Sigils she had already gifted to humans around the universe. Soon, she would awaken and begin to reclaim the gifts she had given.<p>Many of the Sigil-bearers believe their new powers were given to them by some kind of god or other unknown force. In reality, the Sigils unlocked the ultimate potential of their bearers, shooting them up to the top of the evolutionary ladder. Each bearer's power is a reflection of their character, and this would mark the path they would ultimately take in their journey towards become the universe's protectors.</p><p>Eventually, Solusandra is \"reborn\" on her desolate planet, and awakes to find many Sigil symbols floating in the air in bubbles around her. When she touches one, she is transported directly into the presence of one of her Sigil-bearers, the first of which is Lindy Karsten. When she comes in contact with Lindy, she \"steals\" the Sigil back, and regains a portion of her memories and god-like power. With Lindy in tow, Solusandra embarks on a quest to reclaim all her Sigils, but is not entirely successful as a few keep theirs, and some are no longer accessible to her.</p> Interestingly, many of the Sigil-bearers learn they no longer need the Sigil to access the powers it had granted them. The change to them was genetic and permanent, simply advancing their personal evolution and unlocking the potential within. As Lindy Karsten discovers, whenever their Sigils are lost, the abilities are not gone, and their \"access\" to them rebuilds itself over time. This discovery leads some of the Sigil bearers to have boosted confidence and increased insight which allows them to become even more powerful than they had been before.<p>Each Sigil-bearer's power was different from the next, being an exhibition of the nature and character of the bearer. For example, some granted active healing (such as healing a wound quickly at the demand of the Sigil-bearer), while others would heal passively or a long period of time. Some bearers, after coming in direct contact with another bearer, learned to exhibit the abilities of the other. It might be surmised that all Sigil-bearers could accomplish the same feats given time and practice.</p><p>Though not a hard and fast rule, the Sigil power usually glowed either red or yellow depending upon the use of the power. If the action was \"creative\" in nature, such as healing of wound, self-defense, or rebuilding something broken, the power usually glows yellow. If the action was \"destructive\" in nature, such as causing harm to another or destroying something, the power usually glows red.</p> Danik also bestowed his own version of the Sigil on an even smaller group of individuals around the universe. He revived six of his former race from Atlantis, and gave it at least two separate humans as well. In the case of the Atlanteans, who had already achieved biological perfection, his Sigil does not seem to grant power, but rather allow the bearer focus and added defensive protection.<p>Gammid the Atlantean learns one of the true benefits of Danik's Sigil when he mistakenly ventures into the Negation universe with a group of Australian humans (a group which believes they are undergoing a true Transition. When the humans arrive in the Negation universe, they have gone quite mad, and possess powers they cannot control. Gammid is protected from this, and seems to be able to focus his powers with the Sigil. (In contrast, when a group of Solusandra's Sigil-bearers are kidnapped into the Negation universe, they are unable to use their powers without causing themselves harm.) Through contact with Gammid's Sigil, and through his Atlantean training, many of the Australians survive and harness their full powers. Later, when Gammid meets up with some of the kidnapped Sigil-bearers (in addition to a First of House Dexter), he is able to fully restore their Sigil-powers using his own, different Sigil.</p> Charon, god of the Negation universe, created and bestowed his own version of the Sigil on a group of non-humans from his own universe. He was unable to graft his Ligis (his name for his sigil) on the non-humans until he received the forced help of Sigil-bearer Javi Corben, a former doctor who used his Sigil-power to heal. Javi was then appointed leader of Charon's new group of Ligis bearers, a group of four non-humanoids who worshiped Charon as their god.<a href=\"/\"></a><h2> </h2><h2> </h2><p><br /><a href=\"/\"></a></p><p>Known Sigil-bearers of Solusandra</p><p>===================================</p> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13261\" href=\"/samandahl-rey/4005-13261/\">Samandahl Rey</a> of Gaia:** One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and the most important in Danik's plans for the future. Sam's Sigil gave him molecular control over inanimate matter. Sam's Sigil is located on his chest, and looks very much like a burn. Through the Sigil's use, Sam becomes the leader of humanity's fight against the Saurian race (which only sees humans as food to be eaten). Samandahl Rey sires a child with Capricia of Atlantis.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13193\" href=\"/sephie/4005-13193/\">Sephie</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42971\" href=\"/meridian/4020-42971/\">Meridian</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\">Demetria</a>:** One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and potentially one of the most powerful. Sephie's Sigil grants her defensive shielding, repair of organic and inorganic matter, healing of organic matter, flight, and a myriad other abilities. Through the Sigil's use, Sephie begins a crusade against her uncle Ilahn, a cruel despot bent on world (if not universal) domination. Sephie's Sigil is located on her forehead.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-42988\" href=\"/ilahn/4005-42988/\">Ilahn</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42972\" href=\"/cadador/4020-42972/\">Cadador</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\">Demetria</a>:** One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and one of the most ruthless. Ilahn's abilities included disintegration of matter, energy blasts, self-healing and teleportation. Ilahn is also the first to learn that Sigil bearers can drain the powers/life-forces of the First. Through the Sigil's use, Ilahn strives to solidify his power over the planet, and rid himself of his niece Sephie once and for all. Ilahn's Sigil is located at his throat.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13291\" href=\"/giselle-villard/4005-13291/\">Giselle Villard</a> of Ciress:** One of the original five Sigil-bearers. Giselle's Sigil allowed her to possess all of the spirits of the great masters of her world, and allowed her to perform high-order magic without preparation, material elements, or spells. Through the use of her Sigil, Giselle successfully defends her planet from Animora, an evil First who wishes Ciress as her personal plaything. When Solusandra returned to Giselle to take the Sigil back, Giselle was able to put up fantastic resistance against the goddess, but ultimately failing. Giselle's Sigil is located on her right palm.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-41544\" href=\"/ethan/4005-41544/\">Ethan</a> of the Heron Dynasty on Avalon:** One of the original five Sigil-bearers. Ethan's Sigil grants him the use of a sword of light, as well as multiple defensive abilities and fighting skills, and the ability to heal himself (and later others). Through the Sigil's use, Ethan defends the Herons Dynasty from those in the Raven Dynasty who would see it destroyed, and also successfully creates a free homeland for the Lesser Races. Ethan's Sigil is located on his right bicep.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13194\" href=\"/brath-mac-garen/4005-13194/\">Brath Mac Garen</a> of Han-Jinn:** Brath is a clan leader among the strongest Urelanders clans. He works to unite the myriad clans to better repel invades to their homeland. Brath's Sigil grants him multiple abilities, including personal healing, language translation, and confidence building. Through the use of the Sigil, Brath unites his clans, but is ultimately is captured by the enemy when Solusandra returns to take her Sigil back. Brath's Sigil is located on his chest.<br /> **Sara Janning of Yamivol Prime:** <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43085\" href=\"/sara-janning/4005-43085/\">Sara Janning</a> is an ice miner on the planet Yamivol Prime, far out on the frontier of the Chimera Empire. Sara is in hiding from the Emperor and his family, a dynasty which brought themselves to power through genetic manipulation of their line. Chimera's Emperors have mandated periodic genetic scanning of every inhabitant in a search for genes they can use to take the next step in their family's evolution. Sara has evaded capture since the day she saw her family killed by Chimera forces right before her eyes. That was also the day she was granted her Sigil. Sara's Sigil powers are somewhat esoteric, and don't really manifest themselves until she is fighting for her life against the Emperor who discovers her true nature. Sara's Sigil is located on the small of her back.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13182\" href=\"/mordath/4005-13182/\">Mordath</a> of Quin:** Mordath is an undead human, and the despot conqueror of the Five Lands of Quin. Three-hundred years before when he first tried to conquer the Five Lands, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42951\" href=\"/altwaal/4005-42951/\">Altwaal</a> appeared out of nowhere to end the battle by shooting Mordath through the chest with an explosive arrow. [See: **<a data-ref-id=\"4055-43023\" href=\"/altwaals-weapons/4055-43023/\">Altwaal's Weapons</a>** ] Three centuries later, he is resurrected (but not given full life, only reanimation of an emaciated body) and given a Sigil of power, which he uses to destroy that who stood against him and enslave the remainder of the Five Land's inhabitants. Mordath is likely the most evil and ruthless, and used his Sigil powers nearly exclusively for destruction. Curiously, Modath's Sigil never healed his undead body, and possibly because of his character he never thought to turn his powers inward and attempt such a feat. Mordath's Sigil is located on the top of his head, and is the largest Sigil among all the bearers.<br /> **Lindy Karsten *(AKA Radiant)* of Heliotrope:** Lindy is a designer of high-end MMORPGs for her world. As Radiant, Lindy is the undisputed champion of her world's most popular game (a planet on which it seems EVERYONE plays). Lindy is the first Sigil-bearer to have her mark taken away by its creator, Solusandra. Lindy's Sigil seems to grant her heightened speed and reflexes, giving her a decided edge in the game world. The original location of Lindy's Sigil is unknown, as she always wore a neck to toe gaming suit. However, her suit does have an all-golden version of the Sigil in multiple places.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13202\" href=\"/todosi/4005-13202/\">Todosi</a> of Han-Jinn:** Todosi was a great warrior of his people, the defender of their homeland. When he was granted the Sigil by who he thought was a goddess, he knew he had been touched by destiny. He knew that he had been marked, and that his mark prophesied the fate of his people, but did that fate include victory. Todosi was continually successful in defending his people, until the day the gods appeared. As an \"experiment\" to see if a Sigil-bearer could be killed, one of the First used the Rod of Altwaal [See: **<a data-ref-id=\"4055-43023\" href=\"/altwaals-weapons/4055-43023/\">Altwaal's Weapons</a>** ] against Todosi, successfully killing him. When Todosi died, his Sigil moved to his brother, who then vowed to kill every god in heaven in revenge. Todosi's Sigil was located on the middle of his back.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13196\" href=\"/obo-san/4005-13196/\">Obo-san</a> *(AKA Nobuyuki Tsugawa)* of Han-Jinn:** Obo-san was a devout monk and eschewed all forms of violence. However, he knew that the homeland must be protected, so he lent his wisdom to his brother Todosi, and to the Emperor. When Todosi died at the hands of a god, Obo-san inherited his brother's Sigil, and also came in possession of the very weapon that caused the murder, a weapon he dubbed \"The Weapon of Heaven.\" Obo-san became his homeland's protector in his brother's stead, rejecting his non-violent past, and rejecting the worship of the god as well. He vowed to kill every god in heaven as revenge for the callous murder of his brother. Obo-san Sigil grants him the ability to influence and control other humans with the very words he speaks. Obo-san's Sigil is located on his back, just as it had been on his brother.<br /> **Lord Birrema of Courabo:** Birrema is the beloved ruler of the world Courabo, a war torn world which is now living in peace because of the efforts of his efforts. Biremma is the first Sigil-bearer approached by Ilahn of Cadador for help against Sephie. Biremma, who is at first distrustful of Ilahn and wants nothing to do with him, is soon swayed when Ilahn promises aid for Courabo's people. When Biremma and Ilahn shake hands on the deal, either they sympathetic telepathy shared between Sigil-bearers does not work, or Ilahn is somehow able to deceive Biremma, or Biremma overlooks Ilahn's nature for the good of his people. Biremma ultimately allows Sephie to defeat him once he learns the real truth of her character. Biremma's Sigil grants him the power to fly, increased fighting prowess, and the ability to create armor, a shield, and a sword, all made of hard light.<br /> **Taylor *(AKA Mighty Man)*:** Taylor's world is one of the first planets to suffer a full scale invasion by Charon and his Negation forces. Taylor has used his Sigil power to assume the role of superhero protector of his planet. Taylor, which is Mighty Man's secret identity, works as a reporter at a major newspaper in a very large city. When the Negation arrives, they attack without warning, vaporizing and entire section of the cities inhabitants with their first strike, leaving only Mighty Man as a survivor. Taylor confronts Evinlea of the First, who is now fighting for Charon. He is quickly defeated, and is questioned by Charon, who is searching for Taylor's mentor, and aspect of Danik. Once they have the information needed, Evinlea blows Mighty Man's head off with a blast of power. As an obvious \"clone\" of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\">Superman</a>, Mighty Man possesses the same types of powers, but his levels are unknown. Taylor's Sigil was located just below his throat.<br /> **Kellra Tuskin of Cardeen:** Kellra is Cardeen's leading prognosticator and family/relationship counselor. Kellra is able to see into the future using her Sigil's powers, specifically looking into the coming history of individuals and thereby give them advice to change that future for the better. When Kellra is confronted by Solusandra, she refuses to relinquish her Sigil, and somehow uses her knowledge against the goddess. Kellra is thought to already been highly trained in her vocation well before she gained her Sigil, and that is what guided her ultimate manifestations of powers. Kellra is successful in driving Solusandra mad, making her see visions that cause her to loose all self-control. Solusandra leaves Cardeen without taking back her Sigil.<br /> **Neine of the blue-skinned feralfolk:** Neine is one of the four Sigil-bearers from various worlds who are co-opted into helping Ilahn of Cadador fight against Sephie. Neine had once served as an agent for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\">Ingra</a> of the First, fighting at her side at some time in his past. Neine's Sigil seems to grant him increased fighting ability, speed, reflexes, and flexibility as well was flight. Neine is ultimately defeated by Sephie.<br /> **Mikos of Abyelos:** Mikos is a young boy (teenager) who believes his Sigil powers had been given to him as a gift from a deity. At first, Mikos uses his powers to perform simple \"magic\" tricks to impress children, but he soon learned to harness his powers in increasingly growing measure. Soon, the people of Abyelos begin to swamp the boy, begging him to perform miracles in their lives. Eventually Mikos has all he can stand, and he commands them all to stop, which they all do because his emotional outburst causes his power to flare, turning every inhabitant on the planet to statues of crystal. When Solusandra arrives to take away his Sigil, Lindy Karsten convinces her to give him a short amount of time to solve the problem, which he does at just the last moment. Solusandra then takes her Sigil and departs. Mikos's Sigil grants him matter conversion powers, telekinesis, and matter-energy conversion powers. Mikos cries **A LOT**, and possesses a high-level of chemistry and biological knowledge. Mikos's Sigil was located on his forehead, which he always hid with a funky looking piece of *Liefeld-esque* headgear.<br /> **Johnny Jumpjet of the Helix Worlds:** Not much is known about the hero of the Helix Worlds, Johnny Jumpjet. He is a short, fat, bald guy who wears a rocket-equipped space suit complete with pressurized helmet, even in the perfectly breathable atmosphere a habitable planet. Johnny's Sigil-based powers are unknown. Johnny was one of the first Sigil-bearers recruited by Samandahl Rey for the fight against the Negation. Johnny was last seen about to get his butt kicked by Mordath for asking a stupid question. Johnny's Sigil is located on the left side of his bald head.<br /> **Columella the iron goddess:** Columella is one of the four Sigil bearers recruited by Ilahn for his fight against Sephie. Columella is known as the iron goddess on her homeworld, but where that is and what her story entails is unknown. She is a savage fighter, and thinks more highly of herself than she really should, since she is easily defeated by Sephie, a girl half her age. Columella apparently worked at sometime in the past for Ingra of the First. Columella's Sigil grants her flight, advanced battle prowess, and other unknown abilities.<br /> **Grenang the blacksmith:** Grenang is one of the four Sigil-bearers recruited by Ilahn for his fight against Sephie of Meridian. Not much is known about Grenang or his background, other than he is a blacksmith, and holds clan \"etiquette\" in high regard. He comes close to dealing Sephie a mortal blow, and is then disintegrated by Ilahn in anger. Grenang's Sigil granted him the power of flight, blast powers, and other unknown abilities.<br /> **Turos of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42971\" href=\"/meridian/4020-42971/\">Meridian</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\">Demetria</a>:** Turos was once the Minister of Meridian, father to Sephie, and brother to Ilahn. He is notable as the shortest lived Sigil-bearer on record, dying only minutes after receiving the mark. Unknown to all, Ilahn had been poisoning his brother, so the stress of the Sigil's empowerment was too much for his weakened constitution to bear. He died, passing the Sigil onto his daughter, Sephie.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13208\" href=\"/javi/4005-13208/\">Javi</a> of Larringa:** Javi was a doctor on Larringa who used his Sigil's power to heal. Javi was abducted by Negation agents into the Dark Universe. There he learned he was better able to still access his abilities than any other Sigil-bearer, and also learned he could boost the power of other Sigil-bearers, or members of The First, around him. He is recruited by Evinlea of the First, and is eventually presumed killed at the hands of Negation forces. Buried and left to rot, his Sigil actually keeps him alive and slowly heals his body. He is unearthed by Charon, and pressed into the evil god's service. Being a highly religious man, Javi (after working to destroy him) comes to believe that Charon is the true god and dedicates his life to the mad deity's service. Javi is killed again in a confrontation with Obregon Kaine's resistance group. Javi's Sigil was located on his right forearm.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13213\" href=\"/mercer-drake/4005-13213/\">Mercer Drake</a> of the Karzath System:** Mercer's power is to overcome any physical obstacle to attain a location or object. Back in the Karzath System, Mercer was a pirate and profiteer, using his Sigil abilities for personal gain. Mercer is one of a group of Sigil-bearers who are abducted into the Negation universe and placed under observation on a prison planet. At first, Mercer joins Obregon Kaine's resistance, but eventually departs to essentially find a planet to hide on away from Charon and his minions. Mercer's Sigil is located on his chest.<br /> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13214\" href=\"/westin/4005-13214/\">Westin</a>:** Westin has the ability to see how technology is operated, and uses it to help his fellow captives of the Negation escape from Komptin on his prison planet. Later it is revealed that he actually sees backwards in time when he comes in contact with a device. When this happens, he is able to see how the technology was operated before, and then emulates what he sees, sometimes with less than desirable results.

Shassa rarely wins any of her confrontations, leading many to believe she does not truly understand how her powers operate and is too obstinate to ask for aid or training. A member of Obregon Kaine's resistance, she eventually leaves the to follow Mercer's splinter group, ostensibly to \"protect\" those without a Sigil.<br /><p>Rika the All-Seeing of the Eternal Empire: Not much is known about Rika other than the fact she was tricked into aiding Ingra of the First.<br /></p><p>Riaglal of Forest: Nearly nothing at all is known of Riaglal but for a name.<br /></p>        **Unknown Sigil-bearers:** Various Sigil-bearers seen throughout the Sigilverse. Most of these Sigil-bearers were recruited by Samandahl Rey by order of Danik to join the fight against Charon and his Negation. The furry, blue-skinned fellow was among those captured by the Negation and taken to their prison planet. He is killed during an escape attempt, proving that Sigil-bearers can be killed, though it is extremely hard to accomplish.<br /><p><br /><a href=\"/\"></a></p><p>Known Sigil-bearers of Danik</p><p>==============================</p> **<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13224\" href=\"/capricia/4005-13224/\">Capricia</a> of Atlantis:** The first of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and another of the most important in his plans.

Many of the Sigil-bearer's stories remain unfinished, and in some cases are quite confusing when comparing the stories in individual publications to the beginning storyline of the Negation War. (For example, Mordath is thought killed by Arwyn in an unofficial script released by Sojourn's writer, but he is seen being recruited by Samandahl Rey at the beginning of the Negation War.) The final outcome of the Sigil-bearers and their war against Charon and his Negation remains unknown.</p><br />","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-197771/","id":197771,"name":"Prequel","issue_number":null},"id":41551,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1494/103578-175831-sigil.gif","image_tags":"All Images,The Sigil"},"name":"Sigil","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sigil/4055-41551/","start_year":"2001"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41606/","count_of_issue_appearances":2,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2016-01-16 21:09:20","deck":"Planet Movers are gloves that allow the wearer to lift or move anything.","description":"<p>The Planet Movers (or Kinetic Field Gauntlets) don't actually cause things to move, they just allow the user to apply force to lift or move heavy things without them falling apart under their own weight, but only if the user is capable of moving the object on their own.

The Skunk Works were responsible for the design and fabrication of the still-unequaled record-holding high performance strategic/reconnaissance aircraft the SR-71, and its attack version, the YF-12A. These craft are two seater's and the X-Men Blackbird accommodates a flight crew of 3 and 4 passengers.</p><p>The Blackbird was never realized as part of the United States reconnaissance program, but the international organization <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\"> SHIELD</a> (Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate) acquired the design and exotic tooling experience of this craft from Lockheed and produced an unspecified number of these highly classified aircraft. Only one survives today, the X-Men Blackbird. The rest apparently have been destroyed under unknown circumstances.</p><p>For many years, this has been the X-Men's main mode of travel throughout the world. Currently one Blackbird is designated to each X-Team. The Blackbird has always possessed Mach capability as well as Stealth ability and vertical thrusters. Needless to say, the have gone through many of these jets with time, and the newer ones have been created and modified by <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\"> Forge</a> to have even greater capability.</p><p>The craft is intended to be a transonic transportation device that can carry all current members of the X-Men plus several passengers. The Blackbird is equipped to fly long-distance, high-altitude reconnaissance missions and shorter trips, as well as to any climate. A mission specific add-on pod can be equipped for several pre-planned or dangerous mission scenarios. It is also outfitted for battle with several offensive systems stations which control the built-in laser guns.</p><p>The current Blackbird had been completely re-built using ultra-advanced <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\"> Shi'Ar</a> technology. Some Blackbird was fitted with a special ruby quartz windshield that can be used by <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\"> Cyclops</a> to project his optic blast and magnify its power many times over and a platform that <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\"> Storm</a> use to summon thunder clouds. Although it is a great aircraft, it is not without it own flaws, problems encountered at Mach 4 plus flight speeds, such as high temperatures, mechanical operations and stability, and routine equipment functioning have now been eliminated.</p><h2>Technical Information</h2><ul><li><b>Wing Span:</b> 62 feet 6 inches</li><li><b>Length: (overall, incl. nose probe):</b> 88 Feet 4 inches</li><li><b>Height:</b> 19 feet 2 inches</li><li><b>Weight: (unloaded, including fuel):</b> 125,000 lbs</li></ul><p><b>(fully loaded, including fuel):</b> 145,000 lbs</p><ul><li><b>Cabin: max. width:</b> 9 feet 5 inches</li><li><b>Max. height:</b> 7 feet 1 inches</li><li><b>Max cargo capacity:</b> 20,000 lbs</li><li><b>Normal take-off weight:</b> 145,000 lbs.</li><li><b>Max.

Becomes resistant to many attacks and the vacuum of space as well as no longer requiring food, water, air or sleep, the bands however are incapable of distinguishing water from a proper atmosphere, therefore a wielder of the Nega-Bands could still drown despite being protected from the vacuum of space.

The bands have considerable ability to manipulate, absorb and project various types of energy, except mystic energies, but to a lesser extent than that of the Quantum Bands. They can also be used to manipulate and project antimatter as a means of offense and a power supply. Through the bands users can also teleport long distances as well as open portals to different locations across the universe or into other dimensions besides to and from Earth and the Negative Zone for instantaneous travel as was proven by Annihilus. The unique pair gifted to Noh-Varr had abilities which differentiated them from the mainstream iteration of the super weapon.

Later, (after Marvel acquired Atlas Comics) Marvel Boy apparently returned from Uranus (now calling himself the <a href=\"/crusader/4005-62921/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62921\">Crusader</a>) and had been driven mad by the horrors of what had happened to the outpost.

Reed obscured the sunlight with a smoke machine and the Crusader found his power greatly diminished. When he attempted to draw more power through the bands when the smoke had cleared and he drew more power than he could handle and disintegrated himself. But not all was as it seemed. The Crusader was not actually the human Robert Grayson, but a <a href=\"/thelius/4005-62921/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62921\">Uranian double</a> bearing the Quantum Bands instead of Grayson's own power bands.

And it was learned that the bands were symbols of the station of the Protector of the Universe and actually powered by another dimensional \"<a href=\"/quantum-zone/4020-44748/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44748\">Quantum-Zone</a>\", which contained all of the potential energy of the universe.</p><p>Quasar served well as Protector, he was unfortunately killed by the cosmic assassin, <a href=\"/maelstrom/4005-2493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2493\">Maelstrom</a>, who then donned the bands, but Quasar was able to resurrect himself and reclaim them. Later Quasar was nullified by the <a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a> and was still able to resurrect himself and eventually reclaim the bands again, but not before a <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull</a> (disguised as the <a href=\"/contemplator/4005-13988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13988\">Comtemplator</a>) briefly claimed one of them.</p><p>Quasar was killed by <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a> who claimed the bands during the <a href=\"/annihilation/4045-41287/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41287\">Annihilation War</a>. <a href=\"/phyla/4005-40922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40922\">Phyla-Vell</a> avenged Quasar and claimed his mantle along with the Quantum-Bands. It is worth noting here that when Phyla acquired the Quantum-Bands she was already wearing a version of the Kree Nega-Bands. It was assumed that the Nega-Bands somehow merged with the Quantum-Bands. This is supported by the fact that the Quantum-Bands have functioned slightly differently since then, such as changing users at will when it had been previously established that Quantum-Bands cannot be removed until a bearer is dead. She used the bands to defend the Kree Empire from the <a href=\"/phalanx/4005-9651/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9651\">Phalanx</a> and even destroyed <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a>. Later, after joining the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> Phyla-Vell was killed by Mentor in an attempt to bring Moondragon back from the dead, thus losing the Quantum-Bands. They were reclaimed by Maelstrom who seemingly sought to feed Phyla and <a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4005-6807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6807\">Drax</a> to the <a href=\"/dragon-of-the-moon/4005-56928/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56928\">Dragon of the Moon</a>. Wendell (who had been resurrected in energy-form) intervened and Drax cut Maelstrom's arms off and the Quantum Bands returned to Wendell and he reclaimed his mantle as Quasar.</p><p>Wendell briefly lent the Quantum-Bands to <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Richard Rider</a> who had lost his powers and was dying. Once he had gotten his own powers back and defeated <a href=\"/ego/4005-19936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19936\">Ego the living planet</a>, he returned the bands to Wendell.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/quasar/4005-128630/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-128630\">Avril Kincaid</a> was offered the Quantum-Bands by Wendell Vaughn and was instrumental in turning the tide during the chaos at <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pleasant-hill/4020-61430/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-61430\">Pleasant Hill</a>. She was offered the mantle of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> and instructed in the use of the bands by Wendell himself.</p><p>During the events of Secret Empire, Avril Kincaid seemed to sacrifice herself destroying an energy shield surrounding Earth.

He later joined the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and reported he had found Avril trapped within a pocket dimension and now she and Wendell can swap places as needed; both of them somehow wielding the Quantum-Bands.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598489\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/598489-app.gif\" data-ratio=\"0.7308533916849\" data-width=\"914\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 914px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/598489-app.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598489\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2355/598489-app.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2355/598489-app.gif 914w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/598489-app.gif 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2355/598489-app.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2355/598489-app.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2355/598489-app.gif 914w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/598489-app.gif 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2355/598489-app.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><h2>Bearers</h2><p>The following beings* have worn the Quantum Bands in presumed chronological order:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/stygian-starbender/4005-53560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53560\">Stygian Starbender</a></li><li><a href=\"/ree/4005-53729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53729\">Ree of the Archeopians</a></li><li><a href=\"/trantra/4005-53732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53732\">Trantra of the Trill</a></li><li><a href=\"/mentor/4005-14522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14522\">A'Lars of Titan</a> (worn as wedding rings)</li><li><a href=\"/sui-san/4005-60709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60709\">Sui-San of Titan</a> (worn as wedding rings)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thelius/4005-62921/\">Thelius aka \"The Crusader\"</a></li><li><a href=\"/william-wesley/4005-29146/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29146\">William Wesley</a></li><li><strong><a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Wendell Vaughn</a></strong></li><li><a href=\"/maelstrom/4005-2493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2493\">Maelstrom</a></li><li>An unnamed <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull</a> masquerading as the <a href=\"/contemplator/4005-13988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13988\">Contemplator</a> (only wore one Band)</li><li><a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annhilus</a></li><li><a href=\"/phyla/4005-40922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40922\">Phyla-Vell</a></li><li><a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Richard Rider</a></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/avril-kincaid/4005-128630/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-128630\">Avril Kincaid</a> </strong></li><li><a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Norrin Radd</a> (possible <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">alternate future</a>)</li><li><a href=\"/starhawk/4005-2168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2168\">Stakar Ogord Vaughn</a> (possible alternate future)</li></ul><p>(names in <strong>bold</strong> are the current wielder(s)</p><p>* = This listing is by no means complete, but includes all those <em>known</em> named characters to have worn the Quantum Bands.</p><h2>Abilities of the Quantum Bands</h2><ul><li><strong>Energy Manipulation:</strong> Primarily, the bands are tools for manipulating forms of energy. A bearer of the quantum-bands can affect, alter, absorb, and channel any form of energy found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum\" rel=\"nofollow \">Electromagnetic spectrum</a>, from Gamma Rays to Radio Waves, and this also includes visible light. This affords the bear complete control of the Electromagnetic Spectrum.</li><li><b>Energy Constructs:</b> The bands can construct anything the wearer can imagine from \"Quantum energy\", This energy is derived from the Quantum-Zone, although the bands can absorb energy from all known sources.</li><li><b>Flight:</b> The bands allow the bearer to fly in atmosphere or in space (surrounding the wearer in an energy aura to protect from air-friction or the vacuum of space), and can achieve incredible speeds (Wendell Vaughn once flew from <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> Harbor to the <a href=\"/the-moon/4020-42072/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\">Sea of Tranquility</a> and back in under 10 minutes which means he would have to maintain an average a speed of 2.8 million miles per hour without teleporting). <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> was often clocked at near light-speed. <a href=\"/starhawk/4005-2168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2168\">Starhawk</a> was estimated at traveling at \"thrice light-speed\" by <a href=\"/era/4005-109687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109687\">Era</a>, Eon's child in an alternate future.</li><li><b>Teleportation/Warp Gate:</b> The Quantum-Bands also enable the bearer to \"quantum jump\" or create apertures between the fabric of space/time of various sizes. Allowing the wearer access to the realm of potential energy which the bands interface with known as the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/quantum-zone/4020-44748/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44748\">Quantum-Zone</a>. A wearer can then travel through this trackless, featureless zone and emerge at a different point in our physical space light years away from his starting point only seconds later. The Quantum-bands would enable a bearer to keep their bearings while in the zone and thus emerge where they want to. They can cross countless light years in a single jump (Vaughn regularly traveled from our star system to systems in other galaxies this way) if a bearer so desires. He could take passengers or open gates large enough for a starship. Quasar once traveled this way from Uranus to Earth; a distance of at least 1.6 billion miles in 15 seconds. Important note, however, a bearer cannot quantum-jump within an atmosphere of a planet without ripping a hole in its ozone layer.</li><li><b>Communications:</b> The bands can detect, emit, and receive radio waves; thereby the bearer can communicate with other radio receivers. The bands can also create a “Quantum-link” which appears as a glowing golden sphere about 2 inches in diameter, which travels to the point of contact at warp speeds and connects with any communication device present allowing the bearer to carry on near-instantaneous communications even over extra-galactic distances.</li><li><b>Altered metabolism:</b> One previous bearer of the Quantum bands (<a href=\"/thelius/4005-62921/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62921\">The Crusader</a>) has been known to be able to augment his strength and stamina to unknown limits with the Quantum-bands. William Wesley was shown to be able to lift an automobile when he was field testing the \"Power-bands\". Quasar himself rarely exhibited this ability and only when it was needed. He once lifted <a href=\"/terminus/4005-14542/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14542\">Terminus</a> out into space from Earth with only the assistance of the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\">cosmically powered</a> <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> and he also once physically restrained <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> by himself, whether this was a statement of his augmented physical strength or her own restraint is unknown, though she seemed to struggle against him.</li><li><b>Mental protection:</b> Despite the fact that the Quantum-Bands have no control over the mind or Psionics, at least one previous bearer (Vaughn) had \"programed\" the Bands to protect his mind for mental attacks and takeover. So powerful is this protection that powerful psychics, such as <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> or the <a href=\"/overmind/4005-4812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4812\">Overmind</a> could not overcome it.</li><li><b>Mental/Physical bond:</b> The Quantum Bands bond with their bearer upon contact interfacing the bearer's mind with the Bands allowing for mental control. Permanently affixing themselves generally to the bearer's wrists, the flesh and bone within rendered indestructible so long as the bond with the bands persists. The bond can only be broken upon the bearer's death, at which point the bands could be removed easily. Although, with Vaughn's many resurrections, he has shown to have a link with the bands even beyond death. Note: Despite this, since Phyla-Vell died and lost the Bands, they have been depicted as being easily transferable: Such as when Maelstrom's hands were cut off by Drax; when Wendell offered the bands to Rich Rider; or when Wendell offered the bands to Avril Kincaid.</li></ul><p><b>Limitations:</b></p><ul><li><b>Worthiness</b><u>:</u> Similar to the hammer of <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> ( <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>), a bearer of the Quantum-Bands must to be worthy. As the Quantum-Bands are tied to the station of the <a href=\"/protector-of-the-universe/4015-55736/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55736\">Protector of the Universe</a>, the bands seem to require a calm mind lacking ‘killer instinct’ to learn to use them to their fullest potential. A bearer with the intent to commit acts of depravity and destruction (or simply attempted to force their own will over the bands) will quickly find themselves losing control of the energy output of the bands until they disintegrate them. Despite this, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a> wore the Quantum-Bands for about a full year, but the bands removed themselves from him at the earliest opportunity to bond with Phyla-Vell.</li><li><b>Magic</b>: The Bands cannot absorb it or resist it. However, an enchanted physical object will only be as strong as the object itself would otherwise be. Therefore, Thor's hammer (Mjolnir) will simply not shatter Quasar's force field like glass. Fortunately, magicians have no control over the energies of the Quantum-Bands so, it evens out.</li><li><b>Extra-dimensional energy</b>: Quasar is susceptible to all persons using <a href=\"/darkforce/4015-41411/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41411\">Darkforce</a>. The Q-bands cannot create constructs to hold or resist darkforce energy. The Darkforce penetrates his energy like it wasn't even there. Also powerful entities from the <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">Negative-Zone</a> (such as <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a>) can corrupt the bands if wearing them.</li><li><b>Kinetic energy</b>: The Quantum Bands have no defense against someone manipulating kinetic energy psionically. (Which is why Maelstrom overwhelmed Quasar so easily to begin with during the events of Cosmos In Collision), but a bearer can resist a kinetically imbued object (such as a knife or a deck of cards) If a bearer of the Quantum Bands senses the attack they can throw up a shield to defend themselves with.</li><li><b>Psionic energy</b>: A psionic blast will cut through any quantum constructs like paper mache'. Fortunately, most psionic manipulators are susceptible to the energies of the Quantum-Bands.</li><li><b>Matter manipulation</b>: Foes who manipulate matter, psionically or otherwise, the Quantum Bands cannot effect their powers. They deal with energy, not matter. The <a href=\"/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a>, <a href=\"/sersi/4005-2118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2118\">Sersi</a>, <a href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Phoenix</a>, <a href=\"/kismet/4005-25678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25678\">Her</a>, and the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a>, among others, affect matter in a way that a bearer of the Q-bands cannot. However, Her, Sersi, and the Silver Surfer use cosmic energy to power their matter manipulation abilities and therefore a practiced bearer could affect the energy source, but not the ability itself.</li></ul>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-159035/","id":159035,"name":"The Lost World / Eyes of Death","issue_number":"1"},"id":42361,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2355/8169268-thequantumbands.png","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"Quantum Bands","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/quantum-bands/4055-42361/","start_year":"1950"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-42369/","count_of_issue_appearances":184,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2014-11-28 15:25:02","deck":"A device which can transport someone to the Phantom Zone, a dreaded dimension filled with vast space, where time is frozen yet the inhabitants are not.","description":"<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Phantom Zone Projector is a devise used to transport galactic inmates such as <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/general-zod/4005-13075/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13075\">General Zod</a> into inter-dimensional realm known as the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone</a>, where space and time have in no effect in this void.

This keeps him from accidentally discharging his web when making a fist or holding an object. Not only does it need a double-tap, Spider-Man's web shooter also needs a strong amount of pressure to activate, beyond what a normal human can produce. Each shooter has an adjustable nozzle to allow for strong strands for web-slinging or wide dispersal for web nets, shields, cushions, and more. The shooter’s nozzle reacts to minute flicks of Spider-Man’s wrist to adjust the spray.</p><p>Each shooter has a compartment for a small cartridge of concentrated web fluid which he had developed at home using a chemical set he had. He keeps spare cartridges in a belt under his costume for easy access. In later times, he improved them by installing a rotating carousel that automatically reloads a web cartridge should the current cartridge inside the chamber of the web shooter runs out of web fluid. A steel pin breaks the cartridge, ready to shoot web for web-swinging or ensnaring villains. The web shooter is also prone to malfunction, thus Peter needs to have constant maintenance to prevent his webbing from exploding and entangling himself.</p><p>Later added was a voice-activated function. This allows him to shoot continuous blasts of webbing in different directions and forms. It is unknown what else the function can do at the moment.</p><p>His clone, <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Ben Reilly</a>, uses a modified web shooter that is much the same as Spider-Man's but the difference is that it is worn outside his costume. Peter's daughter from an alternate future, May \"Mayday\" Parker, aka <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\">Spider-Girl</a>, used the same web-shooters her \"Uncle\" used. Back when they were married, Peter gave <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a> a modified web shooter disguised as a bracelet that she can use for self-defense as a Valentine's Day gift.</p><h2>Webbing</h2><p>When Spider-Man taps into his web shooter trigger, the web fluid is shot from a small nozzle. When the web fluid comes in contact with the air, it solidifies into a rope-like material that Spider-Man uses to web-swing across the New York skyline. If Spider-Man taps the trigger hard enough, the nozzle widens its opening, making the web coming out of the web shooter wider. The webbing produced by these cartridges is ultra-strong but dissolves in about one hour’s time, this is why New York City isn’t covered in discarded webs. Spider-Man has improved his webbing formula over the years as he gained access to better labs and chemicals, and he has also developed variations on his web fluid formula for use against specific villains such as when he fights <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a> he has an extremely strong and sticky webbing, insulated webbing against <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>, acidic webbing to melt through <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>'s tough hide and flame-retardant webbing to fight fires or fire elemental enemies.</p><p>When Spider-Man fought the <a href=\"/blob/4005-3182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3182\">Blob</a>, he intentionally took one of his web cartridges and threw it towards the villain, the cartridge broke, exposing the web fluid in the air, overwhelming the Blob into a mesh of webbing, leaving him stuck for the police to arrest him. Ben Reilly, aka the Scarlet Spider, developed his own special web called Impact Webbing, a ball of the web that engulfs a villain into a cocoon, and Stingers, darts that have a sedative to tranquilize anyone hit by it.</p><h2>Organic Webbing</h2><p>In the <a href=\"/sam-raimi/4040-61963/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61963\">Sam Raimi</a> Spider-Man movies (<em><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/4025-34/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-34\">Spider-Man</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/spider-man-2/4025-42/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-42\">Spider-Man 2</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"/spider-man-3/4025-54/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-54\">Spider-Man 3</a></em>), Peter had organic webbing generated by glands in his forearms. This was controversial with fans at the time but proved popular with general audiences.</p><p>To capitalize on this, Marvel decided to introduce the organic web-shooters into the comics during the <a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/4045-43625/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43625\">Avengers Disassembled</a> crossover. In the story arc, Peter evolved biological web shooters located in his forearms. He developed spinnerets under his forearms that can trigger in a similar means to his original web shooters but without the burden of constant build, repair, and upgrade of the device and costly web fluids. The strength and elasticity of the organic webbing are unknown, but it is speculated to be much stronger than the synthetic and is said to depend on Spider-Man's current health and nutrition. Unlike synthetic webbing, organic webbing lasts for a week until it dissolves. But ever since <a href=\"/one-more-day/4045-49939/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-49939\">One More Day</a>, Peter has lost the ability of organic webbing and is therefore using his web-shooters again.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4>Spider-Man Trilogy</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4879370-9083291973-websh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4879370\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4879370-9083291973-websh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4879370\"><img alt=\"The prototype web-shooter on display at E3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4879370-9083291973-websh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4879370-9083291973-websh.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The prototype web-shooter on display at E3\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4879370-9083291973-websh.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4879370-9083291973-websh.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The prototype web-shooter on display at E3</figcaption></figure><p>Prior to this, there were plans to have the web-shooters appear in <a href=\"/sam-raimi/4040-61963/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61963\"><em>Sam Raimi</em></a>'s original <a href=\"/spider-man/4025-34/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-34\"><em>Spider-Man</em></a> movie.

It manifests itself into a weapon that is unique to the wielder. The spirit of the zanpakutō is also part of the wielder's soul and can sometimes share the same personality.</p><p> </p><p>In the Bleach mangas many of the Soul Reapers and Arrancar can alter their Zanpakutō's appearance by releasing the Zanpakutō's full power.</p><p> </p><p>A Soul Reaper's Zanpakutō usually reflects personality and power. An Arrancar's Zanpakutō can take up the form of their hollow powers. Some Zanpakuto's can alter it's user's appearance upon release.</p><p> </p><p>Other Zanpakutō cause physical damage or halt other's abilities. Zanpakutōs can also be used to create power blast that, based on the wielder's strength, can cause devastating damage capable of leveling whole buildings or more.</p><p> </p><p>A Zanpakutō has three stages that they can exist in, and each stage has a different appearance.</p><p> </p><h2>User specific</h2><p> </p><p>In an interview Tite Kudo revealed that the Zanpakutō will react differently according to whomever is wielding it. He stated that if Renji was to hold Ichigo's Zanpakutō, and vice- versa, then Renji would think that it was heavy. In the same way Ichigo would find Renji's unsealed Zanpakutō to be heavy as well.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Sealed State</h2><p> </p><p>The sealed state of the blades are the forms that most Zanpakutōs are carried in by the Soul Reapers and Arrancar when not in use. The sealed state is the weakest form of the Zanpakutō. In this state the Zanpakutō looks like an ordinary katana, and can even be unsheathed and still be sealed.</p><p> </p><h2>Shikai</h2><p> </p><p>The initial release is the first evolved form of the sword. When in the initial form of being released a Zanpakutō usually changes shape. Sometimes it even changes to a form other than a sword. Soul Reapers like Aizen don't change their swords form, while others like Byakuya Kuchiki changes his sword into blades the size of cherry blossom petals.</p><p> </p><p>On the opposite end of the scale there are Soul Reapers who don't know how to seal their Zanpakutō, Like Ichigo and Kenpachi Zaraki. When an Arrancar release their Zanpakutō's initial release their Zanpakutō takes the form of their hollow powers. An Arrancar usually has a part of it's body change back to Hollow form.</p><p> </p><h2>Bankai</h2><p> </p><p>The final release form of a Zanpakutō is called the Bankai form. In the Bankai form a Zanpakutō is in it's most powerful form.</p><p> </p><p>Most zanpakutōs take a form that best aids the user in battle. Maintaining Bankai can be a very tedious task for the wielder and drains their power away. Bankai is a form that requires the person who wields the Zanpakutō to be able to communicate with each other. This can be from turning into a giant monster that the wielder controls and feeds spirit power to.</p><p> </p><p>Other Bankai releases, like Ichigo's, change the wielder's body and gives a big jump to a person in any strength or weakness.</p><p> </p><h2>Vizards Zanpakutō</h2><p> </p><p>Vizards are humans who can use the powers of both a Soul Reaper and a Hollow. Like Soul Reapers Vizards can use their Zanpakutōs for their primary source of power. They can unseal and seal their Zanpaku- tos too. Ichigo's Zanpakutō reveals that it is in fact also his Hollow that exist inside of him. Vizard's Zanpakutōs are in this revelation the source of the Vizard's power, combining with the masks that they wear to personify when they are in use of Soul Reaper powers and Hollow powers.</p><p> </p><h2>Arrancar Zanpakutō</h2><p> </p><p>When Arrancar unleash their Zanpakutō they are releasing the seal that has kept their Hollow powers locked away. By releasing their Zanpakutō they will partially transform a part of their body to what their Hollow form and gain full control of any powers that they had as a Hollow.</p><p> </p><h2>List of Soul Reapers with named Zanpaktou</h2><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Soul Reaper</th><th scope=\"col\">Type</th><th scope=\"col\">Shikai</th><th scope=\"col\">Bankai</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Byakuya Kuchiki</td><td>n/a</td><td>Senbonzakura - The blade splits into many cherry blossom shaped slivers of metal and can shred an opponent.</td><td>Senbonzakura Kageyoshi - A much larger version of the Shikai's ability.

Forged during a time of great need and despair. Illyana was desperate to find a way to free herself of <a href=\"/belasco/4005-10947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10947\">Belasco</a> and find a way to leave <a href=\"/limbo/4020-42990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo</a>. Attempting to use the white magics that her previous teacher, the elderly <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Ororo</a>, taught her. She attempted to create, with all her strength, something that would help to free herself; only to find that she would fail each time. Realizing that she could not properly produce the exact spells as the elderly Ororo because they used magic with differing motives, she reconfigured the spells. She would use a portion of her still intact pure soul combined with her motivation, revenge, a bright light grew directly in front of her. When she reached in she drew forth, what appeared to be a very simple looking silver sword. When she fully grasped it and pulled it from the brightness, light enveloped it completely and a surge of energy consumed Illyana. While in Illyana's hands the <em>Soulsword</em>, as she named it, aided her in defeating Balesco. It also contributed to her ruling in Limbo, controlling her demons while away, and in battle while she was on the Earth dimension. With each and every use of the blade, its strength grew and its abilities increase exponentially. Much later it was revealed that the sword was just the beginning of her magically strengths. Through time a suit of armor composed of the same magical properties as the sword would come to the holder of the blade. It was revealed by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a> that the <em>Soulsword</em> granted leadership of Limbo, and the armor was, by right, the protection given to the owner of the sword.</p><p>More recently, <a href=\"/amanda-sefton/4005-10970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10970\">Amanda Sefton</a> placed a <em>Soulsword</em>, presumably <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik</a>'s, in <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>'s care and keeping.

It's the <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Darkchilde </a><em>Token of Dominance</em>.</p><p>Her <em>Soulsword</em> did though show a number of very specific magical attributes and abilities that included the follow:</p><ul><li><strong>Grants Leadership of Limbo: </strong>He who own/wields the <em>Soulsword</em> is granted leadership or dominion over <a href=\"/limbo-hell/4020-42990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo</a>, though the full power of the sword could only be accessed by Illyana.</li><li><b>Disruption of Magic &amp; Breaking of Spells: </b>This includes its very lethal nature to that of magical beings.</li><li><b>Soul Absorption.</b></li><li><b>Sword Summoning: </b>Granting the owner of the sword to place and store it in absolute nothingness and allowing the own to retrieve from whence its place with ease.</li><li><b>Teleportation Disc's: </b>As a result of the <em>Soulsword</em> being forge from as piece of Illyana's soul, it would wields the ability to create teleportation stepping disc's. Thus allowing the current owner the same ability.</li><li><b>Dimensional Manipulation: </b>The ruler of Limbo can mentally manipulate the physical appearance of Limbo, allowing it to look/appear as they wish it to.</li><li><b>Augment Magical Powers: </b>Whom ever holds or owns the sword is granted increased magical strength.</li><li><b>Spellcasting: </b>When holding the <em>Soulsword</em>, it grants the hold the ability to cast or produce magic, even if they do not have the ability to do so.</li><li><b>Summoning of Mystical Eldrich Armor: </b>It was revealed by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a> that the mystical armor that manifests on the individual that wields the <em>Soulsword</em> is actually a magical armor provided to any who rule Limbo.</li><li><b>Super Strength: </b>When wearing the mystical armor, Illyana displayed a increase in her own personal strength. Shown when she did battle with her, one time, servant <a href=\"/sym/4005-10291/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10291\">S'ym</a>. During the Inferno invasion the two did battle. Illyana would easily grab S'ym and throw him yards away from her with only one arm.</li></ul><p>The <em>Soulsword</em> is unable to harm beings of non-magical or cosmic origin but for unknown reasons, the <em>Soulsword</em> can physically injure Kitty Pryde, alias <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat</a>, even when she is using her phasing power to become intangible. Pryde, <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">The Beyonder</a>, <a href=\"/amanda-sefton/4005-10970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10970\">Amanda Sefton</a>, and <a href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\">Karma</a> are to date the only other known beings besides Magik who are capable of wielding the <em>Soulsword</em> effectively. When Pryde does so, Magik's armor begins to appear on Pryde's body. Moreover, when the Beyonder once freed Illyana from the influence of her Darksoul, Pryde gained the ability to produce and wield the Soulsword. Illyana later took the Darksoul influence back upon herself in order that she could again wield the <em>Soulsword</em> to save Pryde's life from a demon. The reason for the mystical connection between Illyana Rasputin and Kitty Pryde, each of whom is the others best friend, is unknown but some believe it is because of the time Illyana spent in Limbo with an alternate version of Kitty Pryde.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><p>The Magik from Earth-4210 was a member of the <a href=\"/exiles/4060-19986/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19986\">Exiles</a>. She replaced <a href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\">Blink</a> when she supposedly was sent home. This version of Illyana was much more bloodthirsty, not hesitating when it came to missions involving killing. She demonstrated considerable magical ability, including the ability to forge Soul Swords, but her weapons were identified as a \"Soul Swords of Bata's Circle,\" and were <b>not</b> the same as Earth-616's Soulsword. The Soul Swords could cut through living flesh, and was mystical in nature, with the ability to destroy vampires, including the Vampire King. Magik's first Soul Sword was taken by <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel</a> in battle, but she was able to conjure a new one almost immediately. These Soul Swords were most likely created <i>by</i> her soul, not <i>from</i> her soul. She mainly used these weapons to deflect energies directed at them, focus her spells, and kill.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-23307/","id":23307,"name":"Rogue","issue_number":"171"},"id":42991,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5344/1948904-soulsword_01.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"Soulsword","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/soulsword/4055-42991/","start_year":"1983"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-43023/","count_of_issue_appearances":4,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2021-11-21 22:57:08","deck":"Altwaal's Weapons total seven in number, and each contains either fantastic destructive power, or vast defensive energy.

It is unlimited in potential, though the upper limits of the star-like tattoo of power are determined by the imagination of its wielder. A paradox, the Star Brand came into being when the universe was compressed into a single point of space for a mere microsecond. It has been wielded by several people in various realities.","description":"<h2>Object Description</h2><p>The brand itself is roughly the size of the palm of the hand and as far as has been shown is immaterial and effectively only two-dimensional. The Brand is utterly black in color and is smooth and warm to the touch. As long as it is somewhere on their skin the bearer may wield its powers. The brand can be transferred to another part of the body if the bearer wills it by skin-to-skin contact, thus the bearer can choose to place the Star Brand anywhere on his person, willing it into his hand then placing it anywhere on their body. However, this transfer involves some energy discharge, and the brand will burn off any hair it is placed over.</p><p>The Star Brand and its power can be transferred to another person, but former owners are always left with a remaining residue of about 10% of its power, a residue which regenerates and in time will grow to equal that of the original. In the series it was stated that the power of the brand is infinite. So 10% of infinite power is still infinite power.</p><p>When the Brand is transferred to a lower animal or plant, they burn out quickly and do not survive. When it is transferred to an inanimate object, it creates an enormous explosive release of energy with mutagenic and destructive results, capable of destroying a city or even affecting a whole planet.</p><h2>Object History</h2><h3>New Universe</h3><p>In the <a href=\"/new-universe/4020-55729/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55729\">New Universe</a>, on July 22, 1986, the Earth was bathed in a blinding flash of light. In the wake of this “<a href=\"/white-event/4015-56185/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56185\">White Event</a>” people all over the world began developing strange paranormal powers, some mutated physically in ways which seemed to defy medical science.</p><p>The White Event was triggered when the <a href=\"/old-man/4005-62045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62045\"> Old Man</a> attempted to pass on the Star Brand onto an inanimate object, in this case an asteroid in order to get rid of the power. The brand released a huge amount of energy which bombarded the Earth. Realizing that that he would not be free of the Star Brand so easily, the Old Man came to Earth and gave the Brand to the first person he met, <a href=\"/star-brand/4005-30118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30118\"> Ken Connell</a>.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-173629\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7086/173629-192900-star-brand.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7086/173629-192900-star-brand.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-173629\"><img alt=\"Ken Connell gets the Star Brand\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7086/173629-192900-star-brand.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7086/173629-192900-star-brand.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\"></a><figcaption>Ken Connell gets the Star Brand</figcaption></figure><p>Connell was a car mechanic from Pittsburgh; he often tried to use the Star Brand’s power to help others, but was often thwarted by the complexities of the real world. Though given a suit by the Old Man, but he found he rarely had the time to change in the face of a real emergency and supposedly it was as invulnerable as he, its invulnerability was exposed as an illusion. He later donned a spandex body suit and mask to openly fight terrorists, but this led to disaster. Though intelligent, he was self-involved and lacked the imagination and curiosity that would allow him to understand and wield the brand to its fullest potential. He eventually decided that he would be better off without his powers, and unintentionally caused the destruction of all of Pittsburgh the “Black Event” when attempting to transfer the brand to a bar-bell.</p><p>While possessed of the Star Brand, Connell conceived a child with <a href=\"/debbie/4005-30335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30335\">Debbie “The Duck” Fix</a>. The child was born fully conscious of its power, growing at an accelerated rate physically and mentally through the influence of the Brand. Despite being painfully naive to the ways of the world, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-star-brand-baby/4005-29807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29807\">Starchild</a> was much more selfless and had a much more instinctual grasp of the power than his father ever did. After several attempts to better the world through direct usage of his power, the child retreated out into space to meditate onto how to best use the power. The child chose an elderly man who was less impulsive; deciding that the key to proper use of the Brand was to give it to someone was more wise and experienced in worldly matters. <a href=\"/jacob-burnley/4005-29484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29484\">Jacob Burnley</a> was a retired janitor and veteran of World War II, who only used his power after much consideration and put it to many new uses. In time he de-powered the power-hungry President of the United States and attempted to rebuild Pittsburgh.</p><p>Eventually, the Star Child soon realized that the Brand was a cosmic anomaly which no good could come from, therefore should be locked away for all eternity. It learned that the original White Event actually created the Brand itself, sending its energies 500 years back in time, when the Old Man originally lived. In fact, it turned out that the Old Man, Ken Connell, and the Starchild were all the same being. The Starchild then replicated and manipulated the original event to make it happen in a safe temporal loop.</p><h3>Earth-616</h3><p>However, the Star Child neglected to isolate the power which had accidentally been transferred to pilot <a href=\"/jim-hanrahan/4005-85485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85485\">Jim Hanrahan</a>, who later, when Quasar was blasted into the New Universe, transferred his portion of the power to <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\"> Quasar</a>.</p><p>When Quasar took the Brand back to his universe, he accidentally passed it on to his secretary, <a href=\"/kayla-ballantine/4005-43978/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43978\"> Kayla Ballantine</a>, who quickly found herself in the middle of a cosmic power-struggle, during which the Brand was stolen by the Deviant, <a href=\"/ereshkigal/4005-46108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46108\"> Ereshkigal</a>, and the <a href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\"> Stranger</a>. Eventually the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\"> Living Tribunal</a> ruled (as the Star Child had before) that the Star Brand should be quarantined from the main universe.

Apparently, in this new continuity, the Invisible Plane never belonged to Wonder Woman at all. It was designed by A.R.G.U.S. and is the main means of transportation for Steve Trevor's Justice League of America.","description":"<p> </p><h2>Pre-Crisis History</h2><p>When <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\"> Wonder Woman</a> was able to return <a href=\"/steve-trevor/4005-15789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15789\"> Steve Trevor</a> back to Man’s World, she was given an invisible plane designed by Amazon science to take him in. Even though the plane was invisible, the occupants of the plane, including the pilot do not also gain invisibility. In the 1940s, it was to be called the “Transparent Plane”. Within the comics, it was a piece of <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\"> Amazonian </a>technology, as the Amazons were depicted with advanced technology. The plane was originally hidden in an abandoned farm, and Wonder Woman’s telepathic powers from her tiara gave her control of the plane and that she could call for the plane at the speeds of sound. The plane also had a drop ladder which was also invisible, and she was usually drawn sitting on the plane wing, controlling the plane from there and battling airborne villains. During the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\"> Golden Age in comics</a>, continuity was not important and the invisible plane had another <a href=\"/origin-story/4015-55832/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55832\"> origin story</a>. With this one, she was to do three tasks, and if she completed in the three tasks, her reward would be a part of the plane, and then she would be able to form the plane with the three parts.</p><p>During the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\"> Silver Age</a>, a new origin story was created. She was to tame a horse called<a href=\"/pegasus/4005-15775/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15775\"> Pegasus</a> and if she could, Pegasus would become the invisible plane would through the other end of the mystic clouds that separated Man’s World and <a href=\"/paradise-island/4020-56187/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56187\"> Paradise Island</a>. The plane then became a jet as new technology was being invented and the plane this time could travel in outer space and allowed many of her friends to also ride along. The rope was rarely used this time however, as Wonder Woman could just pounce up onto the plane and use air currents to glide her towards the jet. The jet is destructible however as Wonder Woman is blinded and ends up crashing the jet near <a href=\"/gorilla-city/4020-55839/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55839\"> Gorilla City</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Post-Crisis History</h2><p>During this time, the jet’s origin story was revised and it was rarely used as Wonder Woman now had the ability to fly. Its origin was that Wonder Woman had been given a Lansinar disc which was a “morphing crystal”. This technology was devised as the <a href=\"/aliens/4015-46567/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\">aliens</a> who created this were blind and could not adapt to their environments quickly enough and so this the crystal was created, so that it could morph catering to their needs. This time, the jet was invisible, and it made the occupants inside invisible as well and propels itself using graviton particles. This jet could also go into outer space and without taking a deep breath; Wonder Woman could stay in space for 20 minutes using the jet’s oxygen supply. It could also attune to her needs telepathically. The jet has weapons, but is rarely used as this depletes the jet’s resources and can render the plane visible. Though it can regenerate, it does it slowly and it is used as a last resort. The jet was still used because it could hold many people, even though Wonder Woman could fly.</p><p> </p><h2>WonderDome</h2><p>Established in issue #140 that the Invisible Plane can shape itself into a flying fortress known as the <a href=\"/wonderdome/4005-10913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10913\">WonderDome</a>.

The kinesthetic sense is the subliminal perception that allows human beings to close their eyes, yet know where the different parts of their bodies are. If you didn't have this sense, you couldn't pick your nose or wash your hair if your eyes weren't open. The poultice, plus the stimuli of rigorous theological and physical training, heightened your kinesthetic sense. It heightens the proprioceptors (the proprioceptive system processes the orientation sense to the brain) and perceptions in your body. That is how you sense where a tree limb or a building edge is, know exactly where it is and never have a moment's doubt that your fingers will close about it...The sacred anointment poultice has a second effect on your muscles and ligaments, specifically on the joints where bones connect and swivel, mesh and respond. There are receptors in these joints called the Pacinian corpuscles that carry the signal to the brain to fulfill proper movement. Somehow the poultice is absorbed into those receptors and makes them especially sensitive...This is what enables you to twist and dodge with unparalelled grace.\"</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-46496/","id":46496,"name":"Local Hero","issue_number":"16"},"id":43809,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/120248-46121-heart-shaped-herb.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Heart Shaped Herb"},"name":"Heart Shaped Herb","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heart-shaped-herb/4055-43809/","start_year":"2000"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-44097/","count_of_issue_appearances":985,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2018-04-26 20:22:18","deck":"A weapon in the Star Wars Universe associated with the Jedi and the Sith.","description":"<h2>Overview</h2><h3>Lightsaber</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1093/125398-194298-lightsaber.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-125398\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1093/125398-194298-lightsaber.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-125398\"><img alt=\"Lightsaber\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1093/125398-194298-lightsaber.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1093/125398-194298-lightsaber.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>Lightsaber</figcaption></figure><p>A lightsaber is a weapon and a symbol of both the <a href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\">Jedi</a> and <a href=\"/the-sith/4060-44460/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44460\">Sith</a>.

Placing the crystal in the hilt requires <a href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\">the Force</a> as someone who isn’t trained in the Force may kill themselves in the process of making one. A lightsaber can also be tweaked to the wielder's liking. This can include the length of the blade and the intensity of the blade. Younglings have the intensity setting on low so as not to pose a threat to others in their training. To use a lightsaber requires great skill, and just like making one, requires the Force.</p><h3>A Brief History</h3><p>After 25,000 Before Battle of Yavin (BBY), the lightsaber became apart of the Jedi culture and they came about when the first Jedi Knights had used a Force power called Jedi Forge, and combined that with an alloy hilt. Later, they used off-world technology and that would keep and bring out the laser, and that would the base design of lightsabers from there on. Around 15,000 BBY, more research could allow the laser of the lightsaber to retract and extend, becoming the first portable energy blade.</p><p>However, being new technology, it ate up the power supply quickly from a belt the Jedi wore and heated up quite quickly, making it unstable. It had to be used for short periods of time. Because of this, they were used more at ceremonies when granting the Jedi their next level in training.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78058/1571021-archaiclightsaber.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1571021\" data-ratio=\"1.0891089108911\" data-width=\"505\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 505px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78058/1571021-archaiclightsaber.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1571021\"><img alt=\"Ancient corded Protosaber\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/78058/1571021-archaiclightsaber.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/78058/1571021-archaiclightsaber.jpg 505w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/78058/1571021-archaiclightsaber.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-width=\"587\"></a><figcaption>Ancient corded Protosaber</figcaption></figure><p>In 7,000 BBY, lightsabers were more commonly used as they became more stable, but they were still depleting the power supply. Even more so, they still had to wear the belt to supply the power, and the belt restricted movement when they were fighting. Around 5,000 BBY, they placed the power supplies inside the lightsaber and by 4,800 BBY they also put in a superconductor. This superconductor would allow the energy to be re-transferred into the power supply, allowing the lightsaber to be always extended. When the lightsaber made contact with anything, the superconductor would transfer the energy through a negative-charged flux aperture and the energy loop would be broken, allowing the energy to then be used for extra power.</p><p>However, the lightsaber with this new technology was then sold on black-markets after 19 BBY (<a href=\"/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith/4025-75/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-75\">Episode III</a>).

It was <a href=\"/luke-skywalker/4005-6315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6315\">Luke Skywalker</a> who brought back lightsabers, and the discovery of Jedi holocrons, which were basically small electronic cubes which could hold large amounts of information.</p><h2>Construction</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70173/1419070-lightsaber_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419070\" data-ratio=\"1.35\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70173/1419070-lightsaber_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419070\"><img alt=\"Cross-Section Of A Lightsaber\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70173/1419070-lightsaber_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70173/1419070-lightsaber_1.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cross-Section Of A Lightsaber\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70173/1419070-lightsaber_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70173/1419070-lightsaber_1.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cross-Section Of A Lightsaber</figcaption></figure><p>To construct one’s own lightsaber required the Force and was apart of the apprentice’s training. First of all, the apprentice had to go into crystal caves, such as the one near the Jedi Enclave on Dantoonie, where in the cave the apprentice would use the Force to guide him/her to the right crystal for them. First, the lightsaber would take about a month to complete, the apprentice had to gather parts and materials to construct a lightsaber, but during the Clone Wars, it is said that lightsabers can be constructed in two days. Lightsabers must have all these basic components for it to become a “lightsaber”:</p><ul><li>Crystals (up to three)</li><li>Power cell</li><li>Power conduit</li><li>Recharge socket</li><li>Activation switch</li><li>Hilt and a grip</li></ul><p>The lightsaber hilt is made out of alloy that’s usually 30 centimeters long, but can vary according to the physical needs of a Jedi – for example, <a href=\"/yoda/4005-5396/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\">Yoda</a>. He is short in stature so he would need a hilt that would be in proportion with his body. Inside the hilt are a set of lenses and energisers which would work with the crystal to extend the laser of the lightsaber (like light bouncing off mirrors). To place the crystals inside the hilt would require the Force, because it required the binding of the materials at a molecular level which would allow an almost-perfect construction. Of course, people who were not Force sensitive could also construct a lightsaber, but they came along very rarely. One such person is Jaden Korr.</p><p>Waterproofing had been considered as apart of the lightsabers feature, because most lightsabers would short out once put underwater but adding such a feature was very difficult. Such Jedis like <a href=\"/kit-fisto/4005-6330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6330\">Kit Fisto</a> came from an aquatic race and went through the trouble of constructing a water proof lightsaber. Another added feature included was the use of a pressure sense so that when the Jedi let go of his/her lightsaber, the laser would retract. It was put in as a security measure.</p><h2>Variants</h2><p>Because the lightsaber would always represent said Jedi or Sith, variants were discovered to suit one’s own needs, physically and psychologically. With that, variations of crystals, hilts, blades and creations of new weapons using the same technology from lightsabers and weapons such as whips, batons and canes.</p><h2>Crystals</h2><p>The main crystal of the lightsaber is the color of the crystal, which will define what color the blade of the lightsaber will be (more below). Certain crystals can be used to change the characteristics of the lightsaber. For example, Nextor and Damind crystals could be used to shape the crystal. Some crystals could be used to make the laser \"sharper\" or broader.</p><p>The color of the lightsaber could be changed by finding crystals of a certain color and using it as the focus crystal. The Jedi had used natural resources, collecting them from crystal caves where as the Sith had reconstructed natural crystals, which created the red hue. The fact that they could reconstruct also meant that they had a much more powerful lightsaber than the Jedi but that made the lightsabers unstable could easily short out. Even so, a Sith lightsaber could short out a lightsaber with only natural crystals in it, though that has rarely happened. However, it should be also noted that Luke Skywalker had used a synth-crystal as well during <a href=\"/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi/4025-79/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-79\">Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</a>.</p><p>At first during 1,000 BBY, crystals of any color was could easily be found, the most common colours being blue, green, violet, yellow, orange, silver and gold. After the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ruusan/4020-58375/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58375\">Ruusan</a> war, in which the colors mentioned before were quite common, the common colours now were blue and green. Others who wanted a different color had to brave dangerous worlds to get their crystals. <a href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\">Mace Windu</a> is an example.</p><p>Colors could also represent a Jedi’s class during the Jedi Civil War, where <a href=\"/darth-malak/4005-47892/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47892\">Darth Malak</a> reigned. A blue lightsaber represented the Jedi Guardian, someone who was forceful and talented in the areas of combat. A green lightsaber represented the Jedi Consular didn’t have great combat skills, but preferred the areas of diplomacy and common sense. A yellow lightsaber represented the Jedi Sentinel who was balanced in the areas of combat and the Force.</p><p>There are variety colors, the most common being blue, green and red. Other colors include:</p><ul><li>Silver Blue</li><li>Silver</li><li>White</li><li>Gray</li><li>Crimson</li><li>Yellow</li><li>Yellow-green</li><li>Emerald</li><li>Gold</li><li>Magenta</li><li>Bronze</li><li>Purple</li><li>Pink</li><li>Turquoise</li><li>Violet</li><li>Orange</li></ul><h2>Blade</h2><p>With a different combination of crystals, users of lightsabers could tweak the blade to their needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Dual-phase lightsaber</strong> - Allowed the user to change the length of the blade, allowing it to extend up to twice its own length.</li><li><strong>Great lightsaber</strong> - However, this one which was up to three metres long on its own, without needing to change the length of the blade. This blade was created to suit the larger users such <a href=\"/gorc/4005-48315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48315\">Gorc</a> who was three meters tall himself.</li><li><strong>Short lightsaber</strong> - Was smaller than the average blade of the lightsaber and was suitable for such Force users like Yoda.</li><li><strong>Shoto</strong> - A knife-like lightsaber, and it was for people who were not attuned to the Force as they could use this without endangering themselves or others around them.</li><li><strong>Training lightsabers</strong> - Are used with Jedi younglings who are just starting out. They are no where near as powerful as full-fledged lightsabers, but if made in contact with them, they can bruise or cause some minor burns.</li><li><strong>Saberstaff</strong> - These special lightsabers also known as double bladed lightsabers had blades projecting from both ends of a long hilt but required great skill and coordination to wield.</li></ul><h2>Hilts</h2><h4>Lightsaber</h4><p>The most basic and earliest of hilts was the lightsaber hilt, ranging from 20 to 35 centimeters long.</p><h4>Electrum</h4><p>This hilt had a royal and finished look forged from gold-electrum and were created specifically for the senior members of the <a href=\"/the-jedi-high-council/4060-45051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45051\">Jedi Council</a>. Known people for using them were Mace Windu and <a href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\">Darth Sidious</a>.</p><h4>Curve-hilted lightsaber</h4><p>These kind of hilts were created during the time when Form II of lightsaber combat was at its heights. These curved hilts allowed precise movement. Constructing the crystal was more challenging because of its curve. It seems as if this type of hilt is associated with the Sith as <a href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\">Count Dooku</a>, his apprentice and many other Sith Masters use this type of hilt.</p><h3>New Jedi Order</h3><p>During the New Jedi Order, new variants of lightsaber hilts were created. Such hilts were.</p><ul><li>Adept</li><li>Adjudicator</li><li>Arbiter</li><li>Consul</li><li>Defender</li><li>Firebrand</li><li>Katarn</li><li>Retaliator</li><li>Sentinel</li></ul><h2>Lightsaber Combat</h2><p>Force-sensitive users trained with a lightsaber had a very versatile weapon with them. It was powerful but also very light and could be carried anywhere. They trained as if the lightsaber were apart of their own body and learned that the lightsaber was bonded with the user in the Force. With this, Jedi could move gracefully with super-human reflexes, dexterity and agility, almost as if they could predict the moves. The lightsaber could be also used to defend the user against lasers simply by deflecting them back randomly or deflecting it back at a target. Projectiles such as bullets would simply dissolve.</p><p>With the Star Wars Universe having a various selection of human and alien races, different combat forms were invented to suit the user’s own needs. There were seven different forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Form I: Shii-Cho</strong>: The most simplistic form. Most Jedi think of Shii-Cho as a good form to fall back on when all other forms fail. Great practitioners include Kit Fisto.</li><li><strong>Form II: Makashi</strong>: The form most adept for lightsaber to lightsaber combat. It is very elegant and precise; much like fencing and requires a fair amount of detailed footwork. Great practitioners include <a href=\"/shaak-ti/4005-46940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46940\">Shaak Ti</a> and Count Dooku.</li><li><strong>Form III: Soresu</strong>: The most defensive form. Soresu users will not attack until they are given a clear opening.

Ataru uses many wide sweeping strokes and force-enhanced acrobatics, making this form difficult to use in enclosed areas. Great practitioners include <a href=\"/qui-gon-jinn/4005-5411/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5411\">Qui-Gon Jinn</a> and Master Yoda.</li><li><strong>Form V: Shien / Djem So</strong>: The main philosophy of this form is \"peace through superior firepower\". It focuses mainly on using an opponents actions against them.

It gives the user a moderate degree of skill in all aspects of lightsaber combat. It also allows for dual lightsaber wielding in combat.

It requires knowledge of all other lightsaber forms to master. Jedi rarely use this form because it causes them to skirt close to the dark side. Great practitioners include Mace Windu and <a href=\"/darth-maul/4005-5406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5406\">Darth Maul</a>.</li></ul><p>Each form of combat could be used to suit each user’s own needs. For example, the lack of height in Yoda meant that he used Ataru form as it was aggressive and fast-paced combined with acrobatics. A lightsaber is also not needed with these forms of combat, as unarmed combat can be applied with these forms. Different terms and techniques could be applied in lightsaber combat such as Sokan, Tra-Kata and Dun Moch.</p><h2>Force of the Lightsaber</h2><p>The way the lightsaber worked was when the lightsaber made contact with anything it would expend its energy and heat. It can cut through anything, though the material of the object depended on how fast it could be sliced through. Simple things like cutting through human flesh were very easy. The person who had been stabbed or cut from the lightsaber didn’t bleed though, because of the heat emitted from the lightsaber. It was so hot, that once it cut through, any veins and arteries got closed off.</p><p>However, something as thick as a blast door would take several seconds to get through. Rather than just slashing it, the user would stick the lightsaber through the door and the heat emitted would melt the door.</p><p>However, technology that was created and discovered has been able to resist lightsaber from rare materials. The base of building a lightsaber resistant weapon was from a metal called cortosis. At first, cortosis armor was developed, where if the lightsaber made contact with the armor, the lightsaber would fuse out. The lightsaber could be reactivated though it gave the wearer of the cortosis armor an upper hand in lasting longer.</p><p>However, the armor could still be damaged by the lightsaber. The next piece of technology was making a metal blade from the cortosis itself. This could handle the lightsaber without breaking, though it didn’t fuse the lightsaber as much. However, the most pure form of cortosis made into a blade could.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-17616/","id":17616,"name":"Star Wars","issue_number":"1"},"id":44097,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5904/213905-170784-lightsaber.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Lightsaber Hilts"},"name":"Lightsaber","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lightsaber/4055-44097/","start_year":"1977"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-44137/","count_of_issue_appearances":3,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2011-05-05 17:06:36","deck":"The Mark of Mana is a necklace worn by Mana Yanowa.

More advanced Sharingan users are able to upgrade their Sharingan to Mangekyo Sharingans. The Mangekyo Sharingan is a more powerful version of the Sharingan and it grants its user unique and powerful abilities. The appearance of the Mangekyo Sharingan is also unique to each user, so it doesn't have a general appearance. The Sharingan cannot be taught or copied but it is possible to transfer the eye with Sharingan to another person although the person will be unable to deactivate his sharingan.</p><h2>Sharingan Abilities</h2><h3>Copying Ability</h3><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127863-162682-sharingan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127863\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127863-162682-sharingan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127863\"><img alt=\" Uchiha Itachi's Sharingan\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4309/127863-162682-sharingan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4309/127863-162682-sharingan.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Uchiha Itachi's Sharingan</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>The ability for which the Sharingan is famed. The eyes allow for anyone with them to duplicate almost any technique performed against them as long as they see the hand seals in motion with their Sharingan activated, however it cannot copy summonings or other bloodline techniques (which would require you to have been born with special characteristics). It however may not be able to copy elements that the user cannot use.</p><p>But as the Sharingan allows the user to copy the opponent's handseals, it also allows the ability to copy other body movements as well, but this is a two-edged sword, for example: it allowed <a href=\"/sasuke-uchiha/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\"> Sasuke</a> to copy the martial arts of <a href=\"/rock-lee/4005-44527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44527\"> Lee</a>, it did not however give his body the enhanced stamina so he tired quickly.</p><h3>Prediction Ability</h3><p>The Sharingan is much more sensitive to movement than a normal eye, giving the user the ability to detect even the slightest movement in view. This gives them the ability to clearly see things they normally wouldn't, and with good judgment, this allows the user to predict movement. This is a very deadly ability in hand to hand combat, though the Sharingan user must be able to physically keep up with the speed of their opponent for it to be effective.</p><h3>Genjutsu Ability</h3><p>The Sharingan is able to cast genjutsu through eye contact with an opponent, this genjutsu only requires skill, not handseals. It is an advanced ability that requires much practice to use effectively. A more adept Sharingan user is also able to instantly realize when they are placed in a genjutsu, although they are still effected by it.</p><h3>Chakra Sight</h3><p>The Sharingan is able to see <a href=\"/chakra/4015-46239/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46239\"> Chakra</a> which is naturally invisible to a normal eye. This is also related to the user's ability to predict movement as they can see the flow of Chakra through the opponent's body.</p><h3>Izanagi</h3><p>A secret forbidden technique amongst the <a href=\"/uchiha-clan/4060-50974/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50974\"> Uchiha</a> clan attained by gaining the power of a Senju, the user is able to in essence become a physical illusion for a short time, making them momentarily invincible.</p><p>The down sides to using Izanagi is that it consumes a large amount of Chakra, and the eye used to cast Izanagi loses it's light and shuts never to be re-opened.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2304812-itachi_sasuke_kakashi_sharingan_20417231_300_281.jpg\"

The user can then see in a near-360° area around their body, except for a 1% blind-spot located behind the neck along the spinal cord. The Byakugan eyes give their user a power similar to X-ray vision in a large radius. It allows them to see the chakra and the chakra flow in the bodies of others, and even enables them to see the chakra points with a high degree of training or natural talent. Its also gives them telescopic vision and even microscopic vision along with the gift of insight; however they cannot use the insight on themselves. <a href=\"/neji-hyuga/4005-44526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44526\">Neji</a> has been said to be have a visual range of 800 meters. Byakugan users also have the notable ability to project chakra from their body, being used to create punishing waves and protective shields.</p><p>An experienced Byakugan user can use their gift to temporarily close off an opponent's various flows of chakra with carefully placed chakra blows, rendering the opponent unable to move the part of their body that was struck. Not only that, but if they seal up the right chakra points, they can kill even the strongest person with just a few blows, as bodies require the flow of chakra to live. This is known as the Gentle Fist technique, which was developed to take advantage of the Byakugan. This technique requires a high degree of chakra control, and the bloodline itself seems to lean to the control of chakra in the Hyūga clan, as they are able to see the flow and control it more easily.</p><h4>Notable Users</h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kaguya-ohtsutsuki/4005-92516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92516\">Kaguya Ōtsutsuki</a></li><li><a href=\"/hamura-ohtsutsuki/4005-107697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-107697\">Hamura Ōtsutsuki</a></li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neji-hyuga/4005-44526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44526\">Neji Hyūga</a></li><li><a href=\"/hinata-hyuga/4005-44280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44280\">Hinata Hyūga</a></li><li><a href=\"/hanabi-hyuga/4005-90649/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90649\">Hanabi Hyūga</a></li><li><a href=\"/hiashi-hyuga/4005-90653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90653\">Hiashi Hyūga</a></li><li><a href=\"/hizashi-hyuga/4005-90771/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90771\">Hizashi Hyūga</a></li><li><a href=\"/ao/4005-68093/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68093\">Ao</a></li></ul>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-162962/","id":162962,"name":"The Man With the Truth","issue_number":"43"},"id":44521,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4309/130466-93237-byakugan.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Byakugan"},"name":"Byakugan","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/byakugan/4055-44521/","start_year":"2009"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-44543/","count_of_issue_appearances":0,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2011-05-05 17:06:50","deck":"The space ship Spike Spiegel uses when flying through space.","description":"<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>History</h2><p>The swordfish was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44534\" href=\"/spike-spiegel/4005-44534/\" slug=\"spike-spiegel\">Spike Spiegel</a>'s main transportation throughout Cowboy Bebop.

Knowing that he needed to leave the Earthly plane to flee the New Gods that were taking over, Chthon created the Darkhold to act as his touchstone to Earth. Chthon can control anyone who uses the spells of the Darkhold and given time he could use it to create a portal to Earth which would allow him to return from his current realm. The Darkhold is also known as the \"Book of Sins\" because it corrupts the soul of anyone who uses its knowledge.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Darkhoold Book was created by Gerry Conway and Mike Ploog and was first mentioned in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-spotlight-3-werewolf-by-night/4000-12194/\">Marvel Spotlight issue 3</a> and seen one issue later in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-spotlight-4-island-of-the-damned/4000-12270/\">Marvel Spotlight issue 4</a> (1972).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Montesi Formula</h3><p>As a note, <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\"> Doctor Strange</a> used the Darkhold to destroy all <a href=\"/vampires/4015-55796/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55796\"> vampires</a> on Earth and created a spell by which they can never again exist on this plane. However, due to his vast power, Dr. Strange was able to use The Darkhold without forfeiting his own soul.</p><p>At one point, a minion of Chthon known as the Dwarf, sent pages of the Darkhold to unsuspected victims, giving them demonic powers. Two members of <a href=\"/midnight-sons/4060-26574/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26574\"> The Midnight Sons</a> accepted pages of the Darkhold. <a href=\"/morbius/4005-6722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6722\"> Morbius</a>, who used a page of the Darkhold to bring his dead girlfriend <a href=\"/martine-bancroft/4005-7569/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7569\"> Martine</a> back to life, but accidently brought the Lilin Parasite as well, and <a href=\"/blade/4005-7570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7570\"> Blade</a>, who was empowered by the Demogorge page and turned into <a href=\"/switchblade/4005-18574/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18574\"> Switchblade</a>, a being set out to destroy all supernatural life.

Hercules godly heritage gives him a natural resistance to most injuries and the addition of the Nemean Skin makes him almost impossible to injure. Because of his love of battle, sense of honor, and already extreme durability Hercules only wears the Nemean Lion skin in the most dire consequences.</p><h2>Origins in Greek Mythology</h2><p>The Nemean Lion Skin originates in Greek Mythology (as does Heracles) and it is in such myths that when Hera gave Heracles his \"Ten\" Labors to repent of his crimes, the first was to slay the Nemean Lion, a beast with an impenetrable hide. The actual mission Heracles was given was to bring back the skin, but when he tried to attack the beast with arrows, he found that it was indeed impenetrable and instead he was forced to strangle the beast to death with his mighty strength and bring it back to the King. So stunned, was the King that he gave the skin to Heracles whom had to remove it by using the beast's own claws.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-414307/","id":414307,"name":"The Blood of Nemea","issue_number":"1"},"id":45213,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1714/144055-27601-nemean-lion-skin.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Nemean Lion Skin"},"name":"Nemean Lion Skin","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nemean-lion-skin/4055-45213/","start_year":"2012"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-45273/","count_of_issue_appearances":3,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2013-09-28 13:57:59","deck":"From \"Supernatural: Origins\" the comic series spin-off to the tv show; John Winchester's journal chronicling everything about his demon hunting days.","description":"<p>During \"Supernatural: Origins\" issue #2, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45073\" href=\"/john-winchester/4005-45073/\">John Winchester</a> is given a blank journal and is told to record everything in it including drawings, photos and anything else he finds on his quest while hunting the demon that killed his wife, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45079\" href=\"/mary-winchester/4005-45079/\">Mary Winchester</a>.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-111439/","id":111439,"name":"Chapter Two","issue_number":"2"},"id":45273,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/934/150149-158672-winchester-journal.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Pictures of the Journal"},"name":"John Winchester's Journal","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-winchester-s-journal/4055-45273/","start_year":"2007"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-45399/","count_of_issue_appearances":0,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2011-05-05 17:06:49","deck":"Combat car designed to run via remote control by the terrorist The Eliminator/Ironside.","description":"<p>The combat car first appears in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18513\" href=\"/who-wants-to-be-a-superhero/4050-18513/\" slug=\"who-wants-to-be-a-superhero\">Who Wants to be a Superhero?</a> as a creation of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43570\" href=\"/ironside/4005-43570/\" slug=\"ironside\">Ironside</a>.

They were made of metal and had scallops on them. They were usually thrown to hit a target and return to <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>. Depending on the artist, the batarangs at times could be folded to fit into Batman's <a href=\"/utility-belt/4055-46369/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46369\">utility belt</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The size has also varied from smaller palm-sized ones to larger ones. Batarangs have also been shown tied to the end of a rope to grasp onto an object or to tie around and anchor to an object, like a rooftop gargoyle. There is also a batarang budget which <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a> once mentioned as \"bigger than you might think\" since Batman at times leaves the batarangs at the crime scene. The budget was so big that Robin was able to transport a Batmobile to San Fransisco without Batman knowing by hiding it in the budget.</p><h2>Types of Batarangs</h2><ul><li><b>Electric:</b> This type of batarang releases a powerful electric charge and was commonly seen in the DCAU, when Batman joined the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League</a>. Robin also uses them frequently in the <a href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\">Teen Titans</a> animated series.</li><li><b>Explosive:</b> This type of batarang is seen in the <a href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile</a> and Batman himself carries some when fighting bigger opponents in the Justice League, however they are rarely effective against the likes of The General and the Greek God, Hades.</li><li><b>Razor Sharp:</b> These are small palm-sized batarangs and are razor sharp. Batman has commonly used these batarangs as shurikens. He sometimes shoots them at his enemies' arms and feet, where they only go a few inches deep. During <a href=\"/hush/4045-40875/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40875\">Hush</a>, Batman stabbed <a href=\"/clayface/4005-9589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9589\">Clayface</a>, who was pretending to be <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a>, in the leg. Also during the <a href=\"/knightfall/4045-40761/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40761\">Knightfall</a> storyline, <a href=\"/azrael/4005-12834/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12834\">Azrael</a> upgraded Batman's costume when he was substituting for him. The new bat-suit had high tech armor and gauntlets that could shoot batarangs or bat-blades. These bat-blades can go for a long distance and go in very deep.

In fact, his uncanny ability to have exactly what he needs is legendary (if not a bit laughable. Such as in the 1960 Batman TV show they had the Bat Shield and Boring Pills.).</p><p>The pockets on the belt are locked, and only Batman knows how to open them (an unfortunate trick for Batman's enemies, who believe that the belt gives Batman the edge). Similar belts are worn by <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a> and <a href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\">Batgirl</a>.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The belt was drawn as a yellow belt with cylinders up until the turn of the millennium. However, In '86 <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller</a> drew the belt with military style pouches, but this change would not come canon to mainstream continuity until No Man's Land. Prior to this belts with pouches were only shown in flashbacks to Batman's post-crisis early years starting the early 90s. A common joke amongst fans is Batman's apparent ability to carry around random objects with the word \"bat\" affixed to the front exemplified in the 60's TV Movie's \"<a href=\"/bat-shark-repellent/4055-56543/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56543\">bat-shark repellent</a>\".</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The belt is relatively simple: a Kevlar strap with a metal buckle. The belt houses ten cylinders which vertically clip to the outside of the belt. There are pockets between the cylinders, as well as hidden pockets on the inside of the belt used for housing one of various Batarangs. The cylinders house different tools for crime fighting.</p><h2>Contents</h2><p>Batman’s utility belt is one of his most characteristic items of special paraphernalia, and everyone in the \"Batman Family\" has the same designs on their utility belts Batman had designed the pockets to be locked, and only he knows how to open them. His belt has a security device on it where it can electrically shock someone or detonate an explosive device to prevent anyone from tampering with it. It is made of a leather strap with a solid steel buckle. There are also compartments that hold collapsible \"Batarangs.\" It can hold ten cylinder cartridges that are equipped vertically outside of the belt. The cylinders hold various tools and equipment Batman needs to fight crime and vary depending on his mission. The list of items is extensive and has been changed and upgraded on many occasions. Many different belts have been created for different occasions, but all (at times) act in the same way that the original belt operates. Some of the more common gadgets include the following:</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/batarang/4055-46297/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46297\">Batarangs</a>:</b> Shuriken or boomerang based throwing blades made to resemble the symbol of a bat. Some Alternate versions of his Batarangs explode, emit electrical blasts, and sometimes come with detonators.</li><li><b>Grappling Hook:</b> Also known as the Bat-Claw. Batman can use this to grapple onto high locations or can grab hold of a criminal by directing it at him, he sometimes uses it to catch run-away street thugs that cannot put up a fight against him.</li><li><b>Gas Mask:</b> This is used to protect Batman from dangerous fumes and other airborne chemicals. This fits over the bottom half of the mask.</li><li><b>Re-breather:</b> allows Batman to breathe underwater or in a vacuum</li><li><b>Night Vision Goggles:</b> This allows for Batman to see in dark or dim-lit areas. It also grants him the ability to view the infrared spectrum. Now built into his mask</li><li><b>Sonar:</b> Used in his mask to locate criminals.</li><li><b>Tracers:</b> Bat-shaped signal tracers that can adhere to most if not all surfaces.</li><li><b>Communicators:</b> Batman communicates with different members of his team and also with other superhero allies using closed-circuited signals.</li><li><b>Lock Picks:</b> Batman uses these to open locked doors.</li><li><b>Cuffs:</b> Special cuffs that only few enemies and heroes can break out of. Batman can quickly lock a enemy to a pole or deliver him to the police.</li><li><b>Bolas:</b> Batman swings these Bat-Bolas over his head to wrap up an enemy.</li><li><b>S</b><b>moke Grenades and Pellets:</b> Batman can throw these grenades in order to use a stealth technique, distract an enemy, escape a situation, or plan his next course of action.</li><li><b>Sonic Grenades:</b> These disrupt electronics and disorient enemy hearing.</li><li><b>Flash Grenades:</b> This gadget is used to temporarily blind enemies.</li><li><b>Mini-Mines:</b> Mines that can fit in any small area or used as low-grade explosives during combat.</li><li><strong>Thermite Explosives:</strong> Capable of burning through most materials<b>.</b></li><li><b>Plastique:</b> Small exploding devices that have a timer or detonator switch to activate.</li><li><b>Tasers:</b> Batman carries this to shock or neutralize an enemy. This Weapon was more than often used in the Golden Age / Movies.</li><li><b>Brass Knuckles:</b> Used to engage an enemy with more force behind his blows.</li><li><b>Tactical Knife:</b> Batman does not use this in combat, but he has used this to cut through many durable materials.</li><li><b>Mini-Computer:</b> Batman carries two of these. One is located in his utility belt and another is located in his left arm. It appears as a virtual computer that he can contact other heroes or find out strategic areas in certain places.</li><li><b>First Aid Kit:</b> Used to aid in treating wounds. Alfred normally uses this to tend to His Master's wounds.</li><li><b>Forensics Kit:</b> Batman keeps two of these, one in his utility belt and the other in his vehicles.</li><li><b><a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite Ring</a>:</b> Inside a lead-lined box is a ring with a green kryptonite jewel to battle Superman if he ever went rogue.</li></ul><h2>In Other Media</h2><h4>Television</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8170547-spongeface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8170547\" data-ratio=\"0.52669039145907\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.7%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8170547-spongeface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8170547\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8170547-spongeface.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8170547-spongeface.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></a></figure><p>The utility belt is famously featured in the comedic, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dozierverse/4015-56919/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56919\">Dozier</a> <em><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman/4075-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-31\">Batman</a></em> show. Due to the tongue-in-cheek nature of the show, the gadgets contained in the belt were often ridiculous, such as a can of shark repellent spray. Sponges were very often used for the flat as paper \"pouches.\" This was very different from the belt in the comics which had only tiny capsules. Frank Miller would later use the idea of pouches and present it in a more practical, grounded in reality way.</p><h3><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/michael-keaton/4040-68794/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68794\">Michael Keaton</a> movies</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8168578\" data-ratio=\"0.44972067039106\" data-width=\"716\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 716px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.0%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8168578\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg 716w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg 716w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62070/8168578-sexysexy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The brass utility belt is featured prominently in both <em><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman/4025-4/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-4\">Batman</a> &amp; </em><em><a href=\"/batman-returns/4025-7/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-7\">Batman Returns</a>, </em>starring <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/michael-keaton/4040-68794/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68794\">Michael Keaton</a> as Bruce Wayne.

(By tagging a ship with one of these beacons, Fett could then utilize his contraband HoloNet transceiver to track ships through hyperspace. Most of these weapons were hidden beneath the hull; the armor plating would slide away during the ship's attacks.)</li><li>The ship was also outfitted with a sensor array that could detect minute changes in the ship's mass, which could be used to find homing beacons.</li></ul><p>Jango also added spartan crew quarters since the original <i>Firespray</i> was suited for short-term patrols. As well as this, Jango devoted two-thirds of the entire ship's interior to the powerful upgraded Kuat drive engines and power generators, giving <i>Slave I</i> the sublight speed of an Alliance BTL Y-wing starfighter — a remarkable feat for a ship of the <i>Slave I</i>'s size. There was a combination airlock and docking ring behind the cockpit, although this was covered by a sensor dish at various points in the vessel's history.</p><h3>Under the ownership of Boba Fett</h3><p>Added weaponary:</p><ul><li>A cloaking device, which was used for rendering a starship or object which is invisible to both sensors and the naked eye</li><li>A Minelayer</li><li>The two rapid fire laser cannons were replaced with an ion cannon and a concussion missile launcher.</li><li>A miniature tractor beam projector was added to assist in capturing bounties.</li><li>A stolen sensor masking and jamming array made the ship invisible to sensors, allowing Fett to enter any planet without hassle.</li><li>He topped the armament off by changing the main ordinance of the projectile launchers to proton torpedoes.</li><li>A swoop bike was also stored aboard to make himself more mobile once on-world, and devoted a piece of the living area to holding cells.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2017506-541px_jangoslave1cleaned.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017506\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3086876155268\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2017506-541px_jangoslave1cleaned.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017506\"><img alt=\"Diagram of the Slave I\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/51394/2017506-541px_jangoslave1cleaned.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/51394/2017506-541px_jangoslave1cleaned.jpg 541w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\" data-width=\"733\"></a><figcaption>Diagram of the Slave I</figcaption></figure>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-20880/","id":20880,"name":"The Empire Strikes Back: To Be a Jedi","issue_number":"42"},"id":46372,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7075/176846-81492-slave-i.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"Slave I","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/slave-i/4055-46372/","start_year":"1980"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-46445/","count_of_issue_appearances":258,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2016-04-21 02:17:01","deck":"The 7 magic Dragon Balls, when gathered, are able to summon a mystic dragon capable of granting wishes","description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Dragon Balls, numbered 1 through 7, when collectively gathered, can be used to summon the eternal dragon who can grant wishes to the summoner. The Dragon Balls were originally created by the <a href=\"/namekian/4060-55883/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55883\"> Namekians</a>.</p><p>There are four different sets of Dragon Balls in total. There are the Earth Dragon Balls, Namek Dragon Balls, the Super Dragon Balls, and the non-canon Black Star Dragon Balls. Each set of Dragon Balls can grant wishes, but their power and appearance differ slightly from the other balls. If the creator of a set of Dragon Balls dies, the Dragon Balls will turn to stone and become useless unless they are restored by another Namekian, or the creator is brought back to life.</p><h3>Earth's Dragon Balls</h3><p>The Earth Dragon Balls were made by the Namekian, <a href=\"/kame-sennin/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\"> Kami</a>, when he traveled to the planet Earth. Once used, they are turned into stone, and cannot be used unless revived by Kami, or another Namekian for one year. If only one wish is granted, they can be located again in four months time. Once used, the dragon balls disperse across the planet and must be found again.</p><p>The Earth dragon balls summon the eternal dragon <a href=\"/shenron/4005-56391/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56391\"> Shenron</a>. He can grant one wish. When he was revived by <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\"> Dende</a>, he could grant two. He can only revive a person from death once.</p><p>The first Dragon Ball introduced was the \"4 Star\" ball. It was carried by <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\"> Goku</a> through much of the original Dragon Ball series. It was said that the \"4 Star\" ball held the spirit of <a href=\"/grandpa-gohan/4005-60657/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60657\"> Grampa Gohan</a>, his adoptive Grandfather. These Dragon Balls could be found using the <a href=\"/dragon-radar/4055-56021/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56021\"> Dragon Radar</a>, an invention made by <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\"> Bulma Briefs</a> of <a href=\"/capsule-corporation/4020-56243/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56243\"> Capsule Corporation</a>.</p><h3>Namekian Dragon Balls</h3><p>There are also seven dragon balls on the planet Namek, home of their origin. They are much larger than the Earth dragon balls. They summon the eternal dragon <a href=\"/porunga/4005-58447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58447\"> Porunga</a>, who is capable of granting three wishes and has no limitations on reviving the dead, although he can only revive one person at a time. After Namek's destruction, the Namekian dragon balls followed the Namekians to their new home.</p><p>Not only does Porunga grant more wishes than Shenron, he can also be summoned every 130 days, as opposed to Shenron's full year.</p><h3>Super Dragon Balls</h3><p>Dragon Ball Super introduced the Super Dragon Balls that are each the size of a planet and are scattered throughout the universe. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/champa/4005-123537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-123537\">Champa</a> stated the Namekians took pieces of them to create their Dragon Balls. The Super Dragon Balls are also said to be able to grant any wish.</p><h3>Black Star Dragon Balls</h3><p>The Black Star Dragon Balls are an anime only set of Dragon Balls introduced in Dragon Ball GT. Cosmetically, these Dragon Balls look nearly identical to the more commonly seen set on Earth with the only difference being the stars adorning the surface are black rather than the typical red stars. The Black Star Dragon Balls are said to be much more powerful than both the Earth's Dragon Balls and the Namekian Dragon Balls.</p><p>Ultimate Shenron, the dragon of this set, looks very similar to Shenron. The only differences are that Ultimate Shenron is red and is significantly larger. His head is larger than Kami's Lookout. He is said to have no limits on his wish granting capabilities.</p><p>To offset the incredible power of the Black Star Dragon Balls, they are restricted to only one wish and after that wish the balls are scattered throughout the universe. If the balls are not all returned to their host planet after one year, the planet will explode. For this dangerous reason they were kept sealed away in Kami's Lookout for many years.</p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-300054/","id":300054,"name":"No. 51, 1984","issue_number":"838"},"id":46445,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8669/214137-72072-dragon-balls.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Dragonballs,gallery"},"name":"Dragon Balls","site_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dragon-balls/4055-46445/","start_year":"1984"},{"aliases":"Pistol sword","api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-46447/","count_of_issue_appearances":3,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:50","date_last_updated":"2014-08-10 08:33:36","deck":"It's a sword and a gun.","description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-240430/","id":240430,"name":null,"issue_number":"1"},"id":46447,"image":{"icon_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","medium_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","screen_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","screen_large_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","small_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","super_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","thumb_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","tiny_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","original_url":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11122/111222211/6373148-blank.png","image_tags":",All Images,asgard,Avatars,carpediem081108,Classified: Dark Syntinel,Custom Pack,dp,Heroes/Villains,Jeff Hardy,Kurama,Mack's Gallery,Mangekyou Sharingan,Mis,My Off-Topic Shizzzzzz,My Pics,Old pics,other,Other Pictures,Pics for my Background,pics of characters i found,Sorting,Spider-Man and Etc..

Hayden first learned of it's existence from the first Psycho-Pirate, <a href=\"/psycho-pirate-halstead/4005-82402/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82402\">Charles Halstead</a>, while sharing a cell with him. Originally, several Medusa Masks existed, each dominating a single emotion, but Hayden re-forged their metal into a single faceplate. While this gave him power above all the emotional spectrum, the mask forced a form of emotional vampirism as its cost upon Hayden, forcing him to consume emotions to survive. The Medusa Mask allows the Psycho-Pirate to promote and project emotions in other people, and during the \"<a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Second Crisis</a>\" in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/animal-man/4050-3976/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3976\">Animal Man</a>, the mask holds the remnants of the <a href=\"/dc-multiverse/4015-43603/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43603\">multiverse</a>, with the capability to summon any of the destroyed characters of the countless realities that once existed. Hayden appeared to be consumed by its power and it was left to be worn by former physicist, <a href=\"/james-highwater/4005-50468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50468\">James Highwater</a>. Hayden would later return as the Psycho-Pirate, with the Medusa Mask in tow. When Hayden upgraded his powers with <a href=\"/neron/4005-2227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2227\">Neron</a>'s influence, the mask's metal would replace half his brain and would manifest as a golden eye patch, though by the time of Hayden's stay in the Slab, it had gone back to its familiar shape. In this capability, <a href=\"/alex-luthor/4005-24087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24087\">Alex Luthor</a> used Psycho-Pirate in his quest to recreate the multiverse until <a href=\"/black-adam/4005-4916/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4916\">Black Adam</a> killed him by shoving the mask through his head. The mask appeared in the Raven limited series, and though the titular heroine destroyed it, its power lingered, and started affecting scientists researching its schematics.</p><p> </p><p>Much later, during the <a href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night</a>, <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Conner Kent</a> stole the mask from Black Lantern Roger Hayden, and using it on him, discovered the mask's powers were enough to cut the connection between the Black Lantern Ring and the corpse it was controlling, allowing him to destroy Hayden and Black Lantern <a href=\"/kal-l/4005-62833/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62833\">Kal-L</a>.
