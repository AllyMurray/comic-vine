      "deck": "An ancient mystical order of assassins founded in Japan. They are among Daredevil's greatest foes.",
      "description": "<p>Their master is a crimelord of awesome power and insatiable ambition.</p><p>He desires to expand his influence from crime to politics. It's suposed his ultimate goal is to rule Nippon, to become the power behind the throne.</p><p>They disintegrate when they're beaten.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The nascent Hand first formed about 800 years ago in feudal <a href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\">Japan</a>, as a reaction to the oppressive class system that characterized Japanese society in that period. A number of Japanese citizens left their homes and settled in the mountains. There, they cultivated skill in ninjutsu, and through rigorous training became experts at assassination and espionage. The group officially came together in 1588 under the command of <a href=\"/kagenobu-yoshioka/4005-1798/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1798\">Kagenobu Yoshioka</a>, who turned his samurai school into a bastion of support for the common man. Yoshioka was eventually assassinated, and command of the group co-opted by the <a href=\"/snakeroot/4060-56349/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56349\">Snakeroot</a>, an ancient ninja clan who turned the Hand to demon worship and black magic. The Hand began working as mercenaries, and sought to extend its influence throughout the world.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Hand was created by <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The Hand consists largely of unknown masked people, but has featured numerous named characters at various points in its history. Throughout its history various heroes have been press-ganged into service by the dark magic of the Hand. They have also employed numerous villains.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Chaste</h3><p>The Hand comes into constant conflict with a heroic group known as the <a href=\"/chaste/4060-55828/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55828\">Chaste</a>. This conflict is the first encounter with the Hand experienced by both <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, with the latter first infiltrating and later joining the Hand for a time. The conflict eventually results in the defeat of the Hand, but also in the deaths of the Chaste's leader, <a href=\"/stick/4005-11018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11018\">Stick</a>, and a member of the group named <a href=\"/shaft/4005-5182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5182\">Shaft</a>.</p><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p>The Hand, alongside scion organization <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> and the mutant group Dawn of the White Light, orchestrates the abduction of <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>. They brainwash him, and set him loose, intending to use him as the weapon he was designed to be to kill members of the superhero community. They send numerous operatives out across the world to deal with opponent superheroes, with limited success. They manage to kill and resurrect Elektra and <a href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\">Northstar</a>, both of whom are brainwashed to act as weapons for the Hand and HYDRA. Meanwhile, Wolverine escapes his brainwashing and turns on the Hand, commandeering a <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinel</a> and invading their headquarters, destroying many of the Hand's members, as well as the organization's elite, with the assistance of Elektra, who had also managed to escape her conditioning.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p>Daredevil takes over command of the Hand after the Hand's repeated attempts to acquire a new warlord. He constructs a new headquarters for them in <a href=\"/hells-kitchen/4020-42295/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42295\">Hell's Kitchen</a>, called <a href=\"/shadowland/4020-57004/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57004\">Shadowland</a>, and dedicates himself into remodelling the group into a force for good. The group begins to corrupt him instead. After Daredevil kills <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a>, he and members of the Hand crash the funeral and engage in a massive brawl which almost results in the death of the captive <a href=\"/ben-urich/4005-4799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\">Ben Urich</a>. After a number of clashes between the Hand and the members of the superhero community, it is revealed that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic <a href=\"/the-beast/4005-61555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61555\">Beast of the Hand</a>. He is defeated and apparently kills himself; in the ensuing confusion, control of the Hand is seized by <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a> and <a href=\"/typhoid-mary/4005-1536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1536\">Typhoid Mary</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/elektra/4025-126/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-126\"><strong><i>Elektra</i></strong></a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5830560\" data-ratio=\"0.62315789473684\" data-width=\"475\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5830560\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg 475w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The Hand appears as the major antagonistic organization in this film.</p><h4><a href=\"/the-wolverine/4025-1359/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1359\"><strong><em>The Wolverine</em></strong></a></h4><p>A similar organization known as the Black Ninja Clan appears in this film.

Gifted and cursed with the ability to open dimensional portals with his eyes that produce a concussive force of destructive energy, he was forced to wear a visor made of ruby quartz to contain his blasts. Because of the look and shape of his visor, he took the code name Cyclops.</li></ul><ul><li>Robert \"Bobby\" Drake, a young man from Long Island, New York, was recruited after the sudden onset of his powers incapacitated one of his peers. He was jailed, for 'his own protection' against the angry and confused citizens of his town. Soon afterward, the wall of his cell was blown out and he was approached by Cyclops, who presented him with an offer to join the academy. He was given the name Iceman after his power to manipulate moisture and create ice.</li></ul><ul><li>Henry \"Hank\" McCoy, born in Dunfee, Illinois to Norton and Edna McCoy was a genius with the brutish look. He excelled in athletics due to his physical nature but also studies profusely. When he began to attract animosity for his appearance and mutation, he was approached by Xavier to join his school. Hank took the name \"Beast\" as his mutation granted him larger hands and feet, much like a gorilla and super strength to match.</li></ul><ul><li>Warren Kenneth Worthington III was already a costumed crime-fighter in his own right who went by the name \"the Avenging Angel.\" He was born to millionaire parents and was kept in a private school, forced to hide his physical mutation. He was recruited by Professor X and he retained the codename \"Angel\" due to his large feathery wings.</li></ul><ul><li>Jean Grey was already a student (of sorts) of Professor X prior to the formation of the X-Men. After experiencing the death of her best friend, Annie, her telepathic powers were activated, forcing the young mutant to feel and sense her friend's passing. She was coached and helped by the Professor as he locks her powers away to keep her safe. As she develops telekinetic gifts she is invited to the school to become the sole female addition to the team. She takes the name \"Marvel Girl.\"</li></ul><p>The students are trained to use their gifts by Professor X who deems them the X-Men due to their extra abilities. The team becomes a tightly knit group, growing up from teenagers and learning to properly use their powers. Their first mission is against the evil mutant, Magneto, who is the self-proclaimed \"Master of Magnetism.\" He attacked Cape Citadel and the X-Men prevented any damage or casualties.</p><p>During the initial run of X-Men, they face Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the teleporting Vanisher, the villainous Factor Three, and the alien Lucifer. Early in the series, Professor X is presumed dead and it is learned that he had been replaced, at his request, by the Changeling, a villain who wished to reform his criminal ways. The X-Men are also joined by the mutant Mimic, who has the ability to utilize up to five mutant abilities at a time. Mimic sought out the X-Men in an attempt to make his powers permanent, but was defeated and became an ally for a short time. The team was then joined by two new recruits; Havok, the plasma generating brother of Cyclops; and Polaris, the green-haired, magnetism-manipulating future confirmed daughter of Magneto. Eventually Beast left the team to pursue scientific endeavors.</p><h4>Lineups</h4><ul><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman and Angel</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman, Angel, Mimic and Changeling</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman, Angel, Polaris and Havok</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Polaris and Havok</li></ul><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>The X-Men were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, making their first appearance in X-Men #1 in 1963. Stan Lee created the title 'X-Men' when publisher Martin Goodman turned down the original name ' The Merry Mutants' because he felt that people would not understand what a mutant actually was. Throughout the Marvel Universe, it is believed that the X-Men were named after Professor Xavier, their mentor but it is claimed that they were actually named after the X-Gene, the gene that created mutants.</p><p>One of the reasons for creating X-Men was the amount of mail Marvel was getting from the readers demanding a new superhero team because of all the solitary heroes in Marvel roster. Stan Lee wanted the heroes to have similar origin background, and because \"I could not get everyone bitten by radioactive spider\", Lee came up with the \"Homo Superior\" concept.</p><p>Some have pointed out that it is possible that the team was inspired by DC Comics' Doom Patrol. At the time Marvel was a new force on the comics scene and took a lot of its motivation and inspiration from DC (for instance the Fantastic Four were patterned after the Challengers of the Unknown). The similarities between numerous characters, and especially Professor X to the Chief have led to this speculation.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>The Early Years</h3><p>The Silver and early Bronze ages of comics published stories more in line with the standard at the time, meaning issues that consisted of self contained stories with little overall development of characters. One of the developments of Marvel is that the company became much more interested in character development, but this change was slow and the early years of the X-Men were marred with the same problems as other comics, if perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><h3>Late 70's</h3><h3>Deadly Genesis/Giant-sized X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-13286\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-13286\"><img alt=\"All New All Different\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></a><figcaption>All New All Different</figcaption></figure><p>The first big shake-up for the team came when the original team (plus Havok and Polaris, minus Beast) were abducted by the living island of Krakoa. First Professor X sent a brand new team of untried students trained by Moira MacTaggert. This team included Kid Vulcan, Darwin, Sway,and Petra, but they were quickly overtaken by the island. Petra and Sway were killed but Vulcan was left in suspended animation (partially due to Darwin's powers). When Krakoa released Cyclops to bring more mutants to feed on, Professor X gathered several young mutants who already had experience in their powers: Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Thunderbird, Sunfire, and Banshee. Due to Professors X's mental manipulations, Vulcan's team was completely forgotten and Storm's team became known as the X-Men second generation. Following this mission, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Havok, and Lorna Dane (as well as Sunfire) all left the team allowing the remaining new members and Cyclops to become the new X-Men.</p><h3>New X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833613\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833613\"><img alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Phoenix Rises</figcaption></figure><p>The newly formed team was comprised of diverse but strong personalities, making them very different from the original team. The new team consisted of adults rather than impressionable teenagers, and both Scott and Xavier found it challenging to get the team to work together. On their second mission, the team battled Count Nefaria, and despite earlier warnings, Thunderbird sacrificed himself for his teammates, and became the first X-Man to die in the line of duty. Subsequent missions had also put the new team against former X-Men members such as Havok and Lorna Dane (now going by the name of Polaris), who were under the influence of Shi’ar agent Eric the Red, and Kierrok and his N’gari. It was during these early periods that readers got their first glimpses of Moira MacTaggert, Black Tom Cassidy, and Lilandra.</p><p>During a Christmas trip to New York City, the X-Men and Marvel Girl were attacked by Sentinels, which led to the capture of Jean, Banshee and Wolverine. The remaining X-Men were dispatched to space to save the Starcore space station and their teammates. The team was attacked by Erik the Red, and robot duplicates of the original team along with Havok and Polaris. On the escape back to Earth, the spaceship was badly damaged and could not be piloted through use of auto pilot. After telepathically absorbing the information necessary to pilot the ship from Dr. Peter Corbeau, Marvel Girl volunteered to fly the ship back to Earth. She assumed that by creating a psionic shield of telekinetic energy she would be safe, and simultaneously forced Cyclops to sleep as she flew the ship back to Earth. Unfortunately, her body could not handle the strain and she perished. However, she is approached by a mysterious force that calls itself the Phoenix, and breathes new life into her. Her old burnt body is discarded as she was absorbed into the new body created by the force, perfectly identical to her old self in appearance. The ship landed in the Hudson Bay with all the X-Men safe, but they could not find Jean. While searching for Jean, she emerged from the river in a completely different costume and a fiery voice, and declared a new identity as the Phoenix. The team was uneasy but grateful that Jean had survived, but they quickly noticed that her powers were much more than they were before. She easily performs feats that she was never able to as Marvel Girl. At this point Xavier starts having visions of an alien being.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Immediately after, the team (except Scott and Charles who were looking after Jean) battled the Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy in Ireland, but before they were defeated, Jean as the Phoenix saved them. Cassidy was working for Erik the Red, a member of another race (Shi'ar) whom along with the help of Firelord, former herald of Galactus (deceived into helping him), seeks to destroy the X-men. Phoenix manages to fight off Firelord, but Xavier is approached by a human-like being from another faraway galaxy, looking for his help. She(Lilandra), a Shi'ar, was led there by the telepathic connection she felt to Xavier from such a tremendous distance. She felt that only Xavier, with his abilities could help her and the universe from the impending disaster. However, Erik the Red (who is part of her race) manages to kidnap her and returns to his home planet via a teleporting device. Phoenix used her powers to revive this device, and the X-men find themselves confronted with the Alien race. Their emperor is in possession of the M'kraan Crystal, which Phoenix discovers to be able to destroy the entire universe by creating a black hole if activated. The X-men defeat the Shiar forces and Phoenix manages to deactivate the crystal using her new found psionic powers and bring the X-men back to earth. Much later, Jean is hypnotized by Mesmero and using her telepathic abilities to enhance his powers, Mesmero takes over the entire X-Men and make them work at a circus. They are however saved by Beast who returned from the Avengers. Wolverine manages to provoke Jean into becoming Phoenix, which brings back her memories and she frees everyone from Mesmero's control.</p><p>At that point, Magneto appears and easily defeats Mesmero. He confronts the X-men in a caravan, and uses it to transport them to his base beneath a volcano in the antarctic. Their, the X-men fight magneto, but are defeated due to a lack of teamwork and coordination. Magneto ties them up to chairs that inhibit their basic bodily functions rendering them totally helpless. After he departs to Asteroid M to do research, Storm manages to free the team and the X-men ambush and defeat Magneto when he returns. However, the facility collapses, and Jean and Beast are separated from the rest, with each party thinking the other dead. Scott's group end up in the savage land while Jean and Hank manage to reach their mansion, where she informs the professor of the remaining X-men's demise. The X-men meanwhile protects the savage land from a resurrected god and manages to find their way back to their home which was abandoned. They track Jean to Muir island, where she is with Moira Mactaggart and there after a joyful reunion they face Proteus, Moira's deadly reality warping mutant son who kills people and takes over their bodies for survival. Proteus kills Moria's husband and takes over his body. With his memory and needs, Proteus goes after his 'wife' Moria, and manages to defeat most of the X-men in the process but is killed by Colossus. Sean Cassidy (Banshee) and Moira then begin their life together.</p><h4>Line-up</h4><ul><li>Professor X, Kid Vulcan, Darwin, Petra and Sway</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Havok, Polaris, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Thunderbird, Sunfire and Banshee</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Thunderbird and Banshee</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler and Banshee</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Banshee and Phoenix</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler and Phoenix</li></ul><h2>Early 80s</h2><h3>Dark Phoenix</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-154910\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5033333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-154910\"><img alt=\"Dark Phoenix\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dark Phoenix\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dark Phoenix</figcaption></figure><p>In one of the most well-known X-Men stories, Jean Grey began to lose control over her powers and personality. She became much more aggressive in dealing with wrong doers. While saving the mutant Dazzler from a Hellfire Club task force, she completely dismantled a car with ease. During this time, the team had recruited a young mutant from Deerfield, Illinois named Katherine \"Kitty\" Pride. Kitty along with Storm, Colossus and Wolverine are captured by the Hellfire Club and held hostage but was eventually rescued through the efforts of an escaped Kitty and the remaining X-Men, mainly because of Phoenix defeating their leader Emma Frost single handedly.. The members of the Hellfire Club's inner circle were meanwhile plotting on brainwashing Jean into becoming a member. A former member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Mastermind, was primarily responsible for the psychic manipulation of Jean Grey. He initiated \"time slips\" to convince her that she was living in the past as his lover, himself being disguised as the extremely handsome Jason Wyngarde. Even though he was not a telepath, this was made possible using a mind-tap mechanism designed by Emma Frost, allowing him to plant false memories into Jean's mind. The X-men go to the hellfire club where Mastermind manages to put Jean under his control, this time under immediate orders from Sebastian Shaw, causing the 200 year time slip in her mind to think of herself as the Black queen. The X-Men attempted to intervene, but it only led to their capture with the exception of Wolverine, who makes a famous stand against the club's security and Inner Circle. Jean eventually overpowered Mastermind, and through the powers of the Phoenix, she put his mind in touch with the universe, which essentially overwhelmed his mind into catatonia. Her actions had caused her to become overwhelmed by her own powers, with each use of her limitless abilities causing her to get drawn nearer and nearer to her own dark persona, causing her mind to become highly unstable. Without warning, she transforms into the physical manifestation of her dark side as they were preparing to leave the area.</p><p>She and X-men engage in a fight, with her trying to destroy them and them, desperately trying to bring her old self back. She defeats them easily, and flies off into outer space, into another galaxy, where she consumes a star for sustenance, causing the deaths of all it's billions of inhabitants. She is detected by a Shi'ar space ship. Having seen what she did to the star system, Lilandra, the Shi'ar empress orders the ship to attack the Phoenix, but the ship is destroyed. Dark Phoenix then returned to Earth, to Jean's house where her family resides. There, she seemingly reverts to her old self and is happy to see her parents and sister, but when she senses the fear in them, she becomes Dark Phoenix again, threatening to kill them. She is stopped by the X-Men along with Beast and Beast confronts Jean in an attempt to calm and help her. With the aid of equipment created by Beast to disrupt Jean's power, they are able to temporarily overpower her but are defeated in the end, but Professor X, aided with the help of Jean from within the Phoenix, engages in a psychic battle with Dark phoenix and manages to defeat the Phoenix persona, putting psychic restraints into her to prevent another transformation.</p><p>When all seems well, the X-Men are interrupted by Lilandra and the Shi'ar imperial guard. As empress, Lilandra is bound by Shi'ar laws to kill the Phoenix for the crimes she had committed against their empire, which was the \"eating\" of a star, and condemning a planetary system to death. The team is transported to the Blue Area of the Moon and Xavier reads Lilandra's mind and invokes Arin'n Haelar, a duel of honor that cannot be denied. The X-Men face off against the Imperial Guard of the Shi'ar. Once the X-Men are defeated, and upon seeing Scot getting cut down in front of her Jean loses control of her powers and personality, and the Dark Phoenix persona arises once again. Before Lilandra could order the destruction of the solar system to prevent Phoenix from becoming a threat again, Professor X instructed the X-Men to subdue Jean. But they only manage to weaken her, and only Scott is left with her in the end. Jean tells Scott through tears that she can no longer bear to live as someone who claimed so many lives, and used a Kree weapon to commit suicide, but not before telling him how much she loved him. Scott then realizes that it was her plan all along that if Lilandra's forces failed to kill her, she would take her own life.</p><h3>Days of Future Past</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833617\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.83606557377049\" data-width=\"305\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 305px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833617\"><img alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine on the run from Sentinels\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg 305w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine on the run from Sentinels\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg 305w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine and Katherine on the run from Sentinels</figcaption></figure><p>With the death of Jean Grey, Cyclops left the team and Angel returned. Professor X promoted Storm to team leader and they welcomed Kitty Pride, now codenamed Sprite, onto the team. In an attempt to deter an assassination plot on Senator Kelly by Mystique's Brotherhood of Mutants, Kitty's psyche had switched with that of an alternate time line. In that time line, the world is ruled by Sentinels, and mutants were sent to internment camps and killed. Most of the known X-Men at the time had perished with the exception of Colossus, Storm, Wolverine and Magneto. They were joined with the son of Invisible Woman and Mr Fantastic, Franklin Richards, and the daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey, Rachel Summers. In order to prevent the apocalyptic future, Kitty traveled back to the past to prevent the death of Senator Kelly. She is successful, however, the alternate time line that she had encountered remained intact.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833618-663504_1_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833618\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833618-663504_1_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833618\"><img alt=\"The Brood\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833618-663504_1_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833618-663504_1_super.jpg 280w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Brood\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833618-663504_1_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833618-663504_1_super.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Brood</figcaption></figure><p>The next few months are tumultuous for the X-Men. Angel leaves again, while Cyclops intermittently returns, Colossus’ sister Illyana is aged to a teenager, Storm is almost turned into a vampire, Arcade attacked the x-men, the mansion is destroyed and Colossus is gravely injured. The X-Men, along with house guest Carol Danvers, traveled to space with the Starjammers and were kidnapped by Lilandra’s sister Deathbird and the terrifying Brood. This lead to Danvers being transformed into the cosmically powered Binary and the X-Men almost being transformed into Brood creatures themselves. The X-Men returned to Earth to destroy the Brood embryo inside Professor X and discover that in their absence, the Professor has gathered a new group of young mutants, the New Mutants. Kitty was briefly demoted to the junior team until she proved herself against a Sidri Hunter on her own.</p><h3>God Loves Man Kills</h3><p>The group calling themselves the Purifiers is laying waste to mutants across the country. They kill entire families, even children without remorse. Two children are killed and hanged in their school playground by a purifier strike team led by Anne, fanatically devoted to her cause. A heated debate is raging between Professor Xavier and Rev.William Stryker on TV, discussing the presence of mutants and their danger to humanity. As Xavier, accompanied by Cyclops and Storm return home from the Studio, they are ambushed and seemingly killed, with the attack made to look like an accident. Their attackers are revealed to be the Purifiers, headed secretly by Stryker himself. As the other X-men investigate the crash site, Wolverine finds out that the bodies recovered did not belong to the three X-Men. They sense an ambush and surprises the hidden purifier team with a direct attack. When things go out of hand, Magneto comes to their aid and they easily take care of the group. The operatives are taken prisoners and tortured by Magneto till they reveal the truth about Stryker and his ministry. Stryker's goal is the annihilation of mutantkind from the face of the Earth. Decades ago, when he realized his own child was a mutant, he killed his wife and child and tried to suicide, but was saved. He regarded this as God's message and considered himself as God's instrument to rid the world of mutants. For years he prepared, gathering resources and people to serve his cause, forming his ministry and thus his 'crusade' against the homo 'superior'.</p><p>Professor X is being subjected to chemical torture by Stryker, along with Dr Ramsey. His intention is to break the professor's mind and turn him into a puppet, and thus use his telepathic powers to attack every mutant in existence. After the torture, striker appeals to the Professor, who is no longer aware of his predicament to use his powers to kill Scott and Storm as a test run, which he seemingly carries out, unaware of what he is doing.</p><p>Meanwhile Kitty Pryde and Illyana spot a monitoring device outside facing the mansion. When they investigate, they are captured by the purifier Anne and taken to a secluded location for execution. However, Kitty escapes and manages to contact the X-men (despite being chased by Anne), who along with Magneto come to her rescue. However Illyana is still in Anne's custody and taken to their base. The X-men later kidnap Ramsey and from him learns what Stryker is planning to do with Xavier. Magneto attacks the Purifier's stronghold and rescues Illyana along with Storm and Scott (who are revealed to be barely alive, luckily just enough to fool Dr Ramsey's monitoring systems). Anne escapes this attack.</p><p>The Reverend commences the final phase of his plan by equipping the professor with a Cerebro-like device that amplifies his sensitivity, and orders him to seek out mutants and people with mutant genetic potential and eradicate them. On Madison Square Garden, he gives a public sermon as the attack is being carried out. The X-men who were preparing to assault Xavier's location is incapacitated. Magneto arrives and tries to stop his sermon but Stryker directs Xavier to focus on Magneto, who is terribly damaged. The crowd goes into chaos and the X-men, led by Cyclops seize this opportunity to attack Xavier. As the professor continues his attack, more and more mutants, including a senator present in the crowd experience pain and bleeding as due to cerebral hemorrhage. Ironically, Anne, who is beside Stryker experiences the same pain and Stryker, seeing she has mutant genes throws her off the podium (despite her intense resistance), killing her. The X-men penetrate deep into the building fighting of the pain and the Purifier forces and manage to stop Xavier, putting an end to the danger. They confront Stryker, who publicly justifies his act as the work of God and prepares to shoot Kitty when he is shot himself by a policeman.</p><p>Later, at the X-mansion, Magneto tries to persuade Xavier and the rest of his X-men to join his cause to create a world where mutants rule. The Professor, disillusioned by recent events almost agrees but is stopped by Scott, who gives him hope. As Magneto leaves, he warns that if the X-men fail in their ideals, it will be his turn.</p><h3>Mastermind's return and Madelyne Pryor</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833621\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833621\"><img alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Callisto and the Morlocks</figcaption></figure><p>The X-Men discovered that Angel had been kidnapped by a community of underground dwelling mutants calling themselves Morlocks and led by a fierce woman named Callisto. In a duel to the death, Storm fought Callisto for Angel’s life and the leadership of the Morlocks. Storm won, but spared Callisto’s life and allowed her to lead in her absence and by her rules.</p><p>In a shocking change to the team, an unexpected visitor comes to the mansion seeking asylum. Former Brotherhood of Mutants member, Rogue, comes to the Professor seeking help with controlling her power. She isn't accepted into the team right away and but proves herself by saving Lady Mariko, Wolverine's betrothed, in Japan who was about to be assassinated. During their stay in Japan, Storm spends time with a thief, Yukio, and realizes that her own personality had changed considerably from the time she joined the X-Men. She found herself resorting to violence more often and easily, and was even ready to kill on certain occasions. In accordance, she adopts a more punk look, cutting her incredibly long hair into a Mohawk and wearing leather and spikes. Combined with her Morlock vest, it is a vast change from her previous looks and temperament. However, on the day of the wedding, Mariko rejects Logan to the team's dismay. As she leaves, the readers are given a brief glimpse of Jason Wyngarde, thus confirming a master plan is in the works.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-808196\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.56125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-808196\"><img alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 800w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 409w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 800w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scott and Madelyne get married!</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Scott, who was on leave, while boarding the plane to visit his family in Canada is shocked to see his pilot - a woman bearing a near perfect resemblance to Jean Grey. Her name was Madelyne Pryor, and they get intimately close within days, as Scott reveals why he is so fixated on her. She meets up with the X-men who have returned from Japan and they are all shocked to see her, but thinks it is mere coincidence. Scott himself however can't shake the feeling that she may in some way be related to Jean, especially after learning that Pryor was the sole survivor of a plane crash that occurred just when Jean died. Later, Scott proposes to Pryor and she accepts, but when he asks her if she really is the reincarnation of Jean, chaos begins as Phoenix seemingly takes her place and knocks him unconscious. It is revealed that Mastermind had recovered from catatonia imposed by Phoenix and seeks revenge against those who loved Jean. The 'Phoenix' later attacks the X-men and they are all led to believe that Jean Grey is back. Xavier, when he uses the Cerebro to learn the truth, is electrocuted. Scott, when he awakes from a dream, finally puts two and two together to arrive at the conclusion that things are not what they seem to be. He devices and executes a plan to lure Wyngarde to the open, which involves evading all the X-men (who are tricked into thinking he is Phoenix) and making Rogue acquire the unconscious Xavier's telepathic powers, which makes her see the truth from Scott's mind. She projects the truth to the X-men just in time when they are attacked by Wyngarde along with Pryor (who is deceived), but defeats him. Wolverine finds out that Mariko does indeed love him and it was all mastermind's ploy from the start. After paying one last visit to Jean's grave, Scott and Madelyne get married in a grant function.</p><h3>The Summers Family Expands</h3><p>Soon after on a mission with Alpha Flight against Loki, they discovered that Madelyne was pregnant. This led more and more to her wishing Scott would leave the X-Men.</p><p>Shortly after this Rachel Summers, Cyclops’ daughter from Days of Future Past timeline arrived in the present. She became fast enemies with Selene, the new Black Queen of the Hellfire Club and was rescued by Xavier. She joined the X-Men without revealing to Cyclops who she really was. She eventually claimed the power and name of the Phoenix from her mother's holo-empathic crystal.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the rest of the X-Men, Professor X’s body wasn’t recovering from a severe beating he had received months earlier by mutant haters. He was slowly on the path to dying and refused to burden his students with it. At this point, he also invited Magneto to stay at the mansion with them as he had begun to repent for his past misdeeds. Also at this time, it was decided that Storm and Cyclops could no longer share the leadership responsibilities and there must be a decision made. They agree to a duel in the Danger Room of which the powerless Storm wins.</p><h4>Lineups</h4><ul><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Beast and Angel</li><li>Professor X, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Angel and Sprite</li><li>Professor X, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler and Sprite</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat and Rogue</li><li>Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, Rogue, Rachel Summers and Magneto</li></ul><h2>Late 80s</h2><p>At the trial of Magneto in France, Fenris, the twin children of Baron Von Strucker attack Magneto as well as Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. They are defeated but Xavier’s body almost gives out. While he is on the verge of death, he asks Magneto to take over the school for him and then he is taken off to space with the Starjammers. In the months that followed, the team fought the Beyonder as part of the Secret Wars II. Rachel was stabbed by Wolverine when she attempted to assassinate Selene. In the resulting battle between the X-Men, the Hellfire Club and Nimrod, Rachel is whisked away to the Body Shoppe unknown to anyone else.</p><h3>Mutant Massacre</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/152700-4814-marauders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-152700\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2484076433121\" data-width=\"314\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 314px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/152700-4814-marauders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-152700\"><img alt=\"Enter the Marauders\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" data-width=\"314\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2532/152700-4814-marauders.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2532/152700-4814-marauders.jpg 314w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enter the Marauders\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2532/152700-4814-marauders.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2532/152700-4814-marauders.jpg 314w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" data-width=\"314\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enter the Marauders</figcaption></figure><p>A group of deadly mutant hunters, the Marauders, start to attack and kill off the Morlocks. Meanwhile, a psychic Marauder, Malice possesses Dazzler, while she's playing in Lila Cheney's band after being outed publicly as a mutant. With Storm being the current leader, she is immediately informed of what is happening below. The team heads into the tunnels and Shadowcat and Nightcrawler are seriously injured. Shadowcat is now trapped in a permanent phased state and Nightcrawler is left in a coma. Colossus also loses control and snaps Riptide's neck. The school is turned into a makeshift hospital for the Morlocks and X-Men who are injured. X-Factor and Thor join the X-Men and New Mutants in ridding the tunnels of the Marauders but the entire civilization is nearly wiped out. X-Factor also sees its own tragedy as Angel is mauled by the Marauders and his wings are ripped apart by Blockbuster and only the timely intervention of Thor saves him. The team also welcomes Psylocke who fought Sabretooth to a standstill and protected the injured at the mansion.</p><p>Following the Massacre, the team is also joined by Longshot, a refugee from Mojoworld who appeared one day in the Danger Room. They go to one of Lila Cheney's shows to rescue Dazzler from Malice, and she also joins the evolving team. Meanwhile, in New Mexico, Havok is having dreams of going to the mansion and being attacked by the X-Men. He travels to New York and finds the team staying in the Morlock tunnels, and he learns about the Marauders and the massacre. He says that he wants to help and Havok rejoins the X-Men, while back in New Mexico, Polaris is attacked by the Marauders in the desert. She takes them down before revealing that she's been possessed by Malice and will be the Marauders new leader.</p><p>During this period Storm and Magneto jointly accept an invitation to join the Hellfire Club to represent the X-Men in the greater scheme. Storm and the team also begin to think that it may be time for the world to think the X-Men are dead. The X-Men receive a distress call from San Francisco from Madelyne Pryor and head to California to rescue her. In San Francisco, they find her being pursued by the Marauders. Havok is horrified to see Polaris leading the evil mutants, but still takes a killing shot at her to stop her from killing Madelyne. At this point the Marauders true leader is revealed to be Mr Sinister and he forced his team to move into the now mostly deserted Morlock tunnels. Madelyne decides to stay with the X-Men since she believes Cyclops to have abandoned her and her son to be missing.</p><h3>Fall of the Mutants</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: Fall of the Mutants</p><p>While investigating a disturbance at Eagle Plaza, the home of Forge, the X-Men are confronted by Mystique's newly formed Freedom Force. During the battle, both teams see injuries, but the conflict ends when the sky opens and a deadly prophecy from Destiny occurs.</p><p>The scene turns to chaos as Dallas is taken by hordes of cavemen and Native Americans. A citadel also appears in the sky covered by an impregnable vortex. With the combined powers of the X-Men, they invade and find the guardian Roma imprisoned by the Cheyenne mystic, Nazé. Joined by a newly repowered Storm and Forge, the team is forced to sacrifice their own lives to defeat Nazé. The event is televised worldwide, so they X-Men are believed dead by both friend and foe. Little does the world know, Roma offers to restore the heroes to life and the team decides to let the world believe them dead.</p><h3>Outback and Inferno</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: Outback and Inferno</p><p>The X-Men have now gone from outlaws to figures hiding in the shadows. After Roma's gift of rebirth, Storm uses the X-Men's appeared death to their advantage and moves them to an old Reavers base in the Outback of Australia.

The team slowly began to fall apart as they stayed separated from their friends. Rogue sacrificed herself to the Siege Perilous to save the team from the Nimrod/Mastermold robot, Storm was taken prisoner and de-aged by the Nanny (with the team believing her to be killed by Havok), and Longshot leaves the team to find himself. Wolverine was off on a solo mission with no contact to the team.</p><p>After receiving a call from Lorna Dane, the remaining X-Men travel to South America and are then brought to the Savage Land along with Lorna by Savage Land Mutates under the control of Zaladane, who claimed to be Polaris' sister. After Zaladane takes Lorna's magnetic powers from her, she develops new powers that cause her to grow taller, stronger, and become invulnerable. After the battle is done the four X-Men are transported back to the outback by Gateway. The team finally dissolves when Psylocke telepathically influences the remaining members into the Siege Perilous in order to save them from a precognitive vision she had of their deaths by the Reavers. Having been cheated out of their revenge on the X-Men, the Reavers took all their aggression out on Wolverine who returned from his solo mission. He was defeated and crucified by the Reavers and would have died if not for being rescued by Jubilee.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9690/259449-28299-siege-perilous.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-259449\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9690/259449-28299-siege-perilous.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-259449\"><img alt=\"To Save Our Lives...\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9690/259449-28299-siege-perilous.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9690/259449-28299-siege-perilous.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"To Save Our Lives...\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9690/259449-28299-siege-perilous.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9690/259449-28299-siege-perilous.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>To Save Our Lives...</figcaption></figure><p>At this time every member sees a drastic change in their lives.

While searching for Cable and preserving the Professor's life, Cyclops and Jean Grey are captured by the real attacker, a psionic mutant known as Stryfe. The X-Men join with the new government sponsored version of X-Factor and members of X-Force to clear Cable's name and find the missing X-Men. It is revealed that Stryfe is a clone of Cable and therefore, in a way, a child of Scott and Jean. His rage comes from his supposed abandonment. In order to save the Professor, the team calls upon Apocalypse to counteract the virus making its way through his body. In the end, Stryfe is defeated and the Professor is saved.</p><h3>Fatal Attractions</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: Fatal Attractions</p><p>Even though the X-Men defeated Stryfe, saved the Professor and rescued Jean and Cyclops, Stryfe still managed a victory in form of a legacy. The Legacy Virus was a disease that attacked only mutants and caused their powers to become powerfully out of control to a fatal end. The virus hit close to home with mutants suffering that had close ties to the X-Men like Pyro, Revanche and Colossus' young sister Illyana Rasputin. Illyana, who had been reverted to childhood following the events of the Inferno, was still a latent mutant in her current form and was the first casualty of the virus. It hit Colossus hard as he had just lost both of his parents soon before. The X-Men held a vigil in her honor with all X-Teams in attendance to mourn her death. Wishing to pay his respects and offer asylum to any and all mutants interested, Magneto crashed the funeral in a show of misplaced aggression. He attacked the X-Teams and if not for the intervention of Colossus, would have lost. Colossus then states that he has lost faith in the dreams of other men, namely Xavier, and wishes to make his own path in a new world and joins Magneto in Asteroid M.</p><p>The X-Men waste little time putting together a strike force to infiltrate Asteroid M and discover the true intent of Magneto and the Acolytes. The Professor chooses a small team of Quicksilver, Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Jean Grey and himself. The mission is successful until confronted by Magneto. In his rage, Magnus attacks the X-Men and makes short work of most of the team. In one of the most shocking moments in comic history, he aggressively fights Wolverine and rips out his adamantium skeleton. The Professor decides that enough is enough and his former friend cannot be saved and wipes his mind. Jean Grey then takes over leadership and forces the team back to the craft while keeping the Professor breathing and Wolverine alive. In the end, Wolverine is left in a feral state with very little active healing ability and unsure of his life and purpose.</p><p>With the Acolytes now in a power struggle, Fabian Cortez assumes leadership over Magneto's followers. He kidnaps Magneto's granddaughter and daughter to Quicksilver and the Avenger, Crystal and claims her in the name of Magneto. This enrages the Avengers and the X-Men who join forces to save Luna and take back Genosha. Cortez is defeated and Exodus takes a leadership role with the Acolytes.</p><h3>Phalanx Covenant</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: Phalanx Covenant</p><p>After recently returning to the mansion, Banshee notices small oddities with the mansion and its inhabitants. He investigates and finds that the X-Men have been replaced by an unworldly batch of beings who are targeting mutants. With Jubilee, Sabretooth and Emma Frost, he escapes to search for the next team of X-Men as noted by Cerebro. Meanwhile, Jean Grey and Cyclops have been on vacation away from the X-Men, saving themselves from imprisonment by the Phalanx. They join with Cable and Wolverine and search for the missing X-Men. Professor X, who had been offsite as well, gathered X-Force, X-Factor and Excalibur together in an old Acolyte base to form a plan. Knowing that the X-Men have been compromised, the other X-Teams split into three strike forces: one to infiltrate the Phalanx with \" Douglock\", a resurrected Warlock with the memories of Doug Ramsey; one to confront a cluster of the Phalanx serving as the breeding grounds to a new generation of Earth born Phalanx; and one team to stay at the Acolyte base if all else fails. Forge is successful in creating a feedback which disables the birth of the new Phalanx. Douglock and his team stop the heralding beacon from summoning the rest of the Phalanx.</p><p>Cyclops team finds and rescues the captured X-Men almost simultaneously and discovers that Cameron Hodge plays a huge role in allowing the Phalanx entry and knowledge of our world. Banshee saves all but one of the new mutants and he and Emma Frost convert the Massachusetts Academy to a school to train the teenage team of Generation X.</p><h4>Lineups</h4><h4>X-Men</h4><ul><li>Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Wolverine, Storm, Banshee, Rogue, Gambit, Psylocke, Archangel, Bishop, Jubilee and Professor X</li></ul><h4>X-Factor</h4><ul><li><p>Havok, Polaris, Multiple Man, Strong Guy, Wolfsbane, Forge and Random</p></li></ul><h4>Excalibur</h4><ul><li>Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, Captain Britain, Meggan, Daytripper, Douglock, Rachel Summers</li></ul><h4>X-Force</h4><ul><li>Cable, Domino, Cannonball, Siryn, Warpath, Shatterstar, Rictor, Boom-Boom, Feral</li></ul><h4>Generation X</h4><ul><li>Banshee, Emma Frost, Jubilee, Synch, Husk, Skin, M, Chamber, Penance</li></ul><h3>1990s X-Men</h3><h4>Many X-Overs included</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/68/77717-156000-joe-madureira.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77717\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/68/77717-156000-joe-madureira.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77717\"><img alt=\"90's X-Men\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/68/77717-156000-joe-madureira.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/68/77717-156000-joe-madureira.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"90's X-Men\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/68/77717-156000-joe-madureira.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/68/77717-156000-joe-madureira.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\"></noscript></a><figcaption>90's X-Men</figcaption></figure><ul><li>\"The X-Tinction Agenda\" The government of Genosha captured mutants and used them as prison labor.</li></ul><ul><li>\"The Muir Island Saga\" The original X-Factor and Xavier returned to the X-Men to deal with the evil Shadow King.</li></ul><ul><li>\" X-Cutioner's Song\" Cable's clone and arch-enemy Stryfe, framed the X-Force leader for an attempt on Professor X's life.

Little is known about what has transpired in that time other than that the Inhuman Terrigen Mist, that had been floating in the atmosphere prior to Secret Wars and is responsible for granting the alien race their uncanny abilities, has slowly been poisoning mutants, rendering them infertile, causing their powers to go haywire, and even spreading a disease among mutants called M-Pox that potentially could be transferred to humans. During this time, several characters have alluded to the death of (present day) Cyclops and an incident he was responsible for that increased fear and hatred among humans against all of mutantkind.</p><h4>All-New X-Men</h4><p>The time-displaced original X-Men (sans Jean Grey) have dispersed across the country in an attempt to live normal lives. The past versions of Iceman, Beast, and Angel reunite to embark on a road trip and are joined by former Jean Grey School students Oya and Genesis, who have both had their fair share of hard times. When time-displaced Cyclops encounters a group of Cyclops fanatics named the Ghosts of Cyclops, he ends up battling them in a school library which causes both him and another young mutant named Thirst to be arrested. During their time in jail together, Thirst questions whether the young Cyclops is a disgruntled child of his group's idol. Scott reveals that he is indeed the real Cyclops and is in fact ashamed of his future self's actions.</p><h4>Extraordinary X-Men</h4><p>Following the demise of the Jean Grey School For Higher Learning, ex-headmistress Storm heads up efforts to combat the effects of the Terrigen Mist that is poisoning all mutants as well as the resulting public backlash due to the spread of M-Pox. To prevent the spread of disease, she has transported nearly all of her former students as well as both human and mutant refugees, to X-Haven, a terraformed deposit of the demonic dimension Limbo, which Magik presides over. However, following an attack by Mister Sinister that takes down nearly half of the team (including their main defense from demonic invasion--Magik), the refugees of X-Haven are forced to step up to protect their new sanctuary.</p><h4>Uncanny X-Men</h4><p>Consisting of Magneto, M (Monet St. Croix), Psylocke, an inverted Sabretooth, and a lifeless \"droid\" Archangel, this group of extreme mutants have banded together to take preventative action against dangerous threats towards mutantkind. Initially taking down the mysterious Someday Enterprises, who had been exploiting mutants by providing a cyrogenic service to take willing mutants out of play until the Terrigen crisis had been averted, the group encounters Apocalypse's minions the Dark Riders, whose mixed mutant/Inhuman membership intend to take out healers from the playing field in order for nature to decide who is fit to survive in this new world: mutants or Inhumans.</p><h4>IVX: Inhumans Vs X-Men</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805878\" data-ratio=\"1.5503875968992\" data-width=\"774\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 774px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805878\"><img alt=\"The war between the X-Men and Inhumans\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg 774w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg 619w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg 412w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The war between the X-Men and Inhumans\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg 774w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg 619w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805878-7739137622-IVX20.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The war between the X-Men and Inhumans</figcaption></figure><p>A flashback later reveals that Cyclops discovered that the Terrigen Mist was poisonous to Inhumans after finding a dying Jamie Madrox. Outraged, Cyclops sends out a psychic message to the world, revealing the truth of the Terrigen. He and his team then set out to destroy the Terrigen Clouds to prevent the extinction of the mutant race. Alchemy manages to destroy one of the two clouds before succumbing to the effects of the Mist and dying. Cyclops vows to destroy the second one, but is confronted by Black Bolt and Medusa, the Inhuman leaders. A fight ensues, and Black Bolt kills Cyclops when he sees him preparing to fire an optic blast. However, it is later revealed that Cyclops had died quite some time ago, and that Emma was simply using his image in order to give him a more meaningful death that could be used to rally the mutants against the Inhumans.</p><p>In the present, Beast discovers that there is no stopping the Terrigen Mist from spreading. The remaining cloud is becoming more saturated, and once it shrinks, will dissipate into the atmosphere, rendering the entire planet uninhabitable for mutants. Beast meets with representatives of the various X-teams and suggests that the X-Men prepare to leave the planet, but instead, Emma and Magneto propose a war to destroy the final cloud. The mutants launch an assault on New Attilan, leading to an all-out war between the X-Men and Inhumans. As this is going on, a team of young Inhumans led by Ms. Marvel discover that the Terrigen Mist is killing mutants, and work with Forge and the young Cyclops to try and find a way to stop the conflict. Moon Girl and Iso are able to explain the truth to Medusa, who voluntarily destroys the cloud herself. However, Emma is not sated by this, and unleashes an army of Sentinels that have been programmed to kill Inhumans. The X-Men and Inhumans unite to stop Emma, and upon her defeat, the conflict ends.</p><h2>ResurrXion</h2><p>In the aftermath of the conflict with the Inhumans, the X-Men set out to rebuild. Two new X-Men teams formed: X-Men Gold and X-Men Blue. The X-Mansion is relocated to Central Park in New York, with the X-Men wanting to show themselves to world and get back to their roots, led by Kitty Pryde as headmistress. Meanwhile, Magneto takes the time-displaced original X-Men under his wing to Madripoor, acting as their new mentor figure. Meanwhile, Jimmy Hudson, Wolverine's son from the destroyed Ultimate Marvel universe, is revealed to be residing in the mainstream universe after the events of Secret Wars. Jubilee is tasked with leading a new iteration of the Generation X team, consisting of Bling!, Nature Girl, Eye Boy, Quentin Quire, Hindsight and Morph with the help of Chamber and Husk.</p><h4>X-Men Gold</h4><p>The X-Men Gold team consisting of Kitty Pryde, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Storm, Old Man Logan and Rachel Grey, faces a familiar foe in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. However, this time, the team is under Mesmero's influence. The X-Men succeed in defeating and imprisoning him, rescuing Magma in the process, who was under his mind control, as well as taking Cleevus, an unknown alien, into custody in order to further examine him. Following the events of Secret Empire, Cleevus was able to escape and return to the Negative Zone, where he is from, and seek revenge on the X-Men.</p><p>A new foe to the X-Men is the mutant-hating activist, Lydia Nance. She has publicly expressed that mutants are a threat to the human race, hoping to wipe them out from existence. It is also revealed that she has paid Mesmero to form the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in order to make mutants look bad in the public eye. Mesmero managed to escape prison with two of his teammates, Avalanche and Pyro, and planned a public attack on the X-Men. While succeeding in stopping them, the X-Men also caused more harm than good as the whole scene was public, and the police were forced to take them into custody, which was Lydia Nance's plan all along. The X-Men were eventually in prison, making Iceman the interim leader of the X-Men Gold team. After learning about Lydia Nance and Mesmero's plans, Pyro decided to leave them and seek asylum with the X-Men. Iceman accepted to take in Pyro as a provisional X-Man.</p><h4>Line-ups</h4><p>X-Men Gold: Kitty Pryde, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Old Man Logan, Rachel Summers</p><p>X-Men Blue: Magneto, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, Angel</p><p><em>and later</em>: Wolverine (Jimmy Hudson), Bloodstorm, Polaris.</p><h2>Major Storylines</h2><ul><li>The Dark Phoenix Saga</li><li>Days of Future Past</li><li>God Loves, Man Kills</li><li>Mutant Massacre</li><li>Fall of the Mutants</li><li>Inferno</li><li>Days of Future Present</li><li>X-Tinction Agenda</li><li>Muir Island Saga</li><li>X-Cutioner Song</li><li>Fatal Attractions</li><li>Phalanx Covenant</li><li>Age of Apocalypse</li><li>Legion Quest</li><li>Onslaught</li><li>Children of the Atom</li><li>Operation: Zero Tolerance</li><li>The Twelve</li><li>Dream's End</li><li>Eve of Destruction</li><li>E is for Extinction</li><li>Riot at Xavier's</li><li>Assault on Weapon Plus</li><li>Planet X</li><li>Here Comes Tomorrow</li><li>Gifted</li><li>House of M</li><li>Decimation</li><li>Unstoppable</li><li>Deadly Genesis</li><li>Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire</li><li>Endangered Species</li><li>Messiah Complex</li><li>Divided We Stand</li><li>Manifest Destiny</li><li>X-Infernus</li><li>Messiah War</li><li>Utopia</li><li>Nation X</li><li>Necrosha</li><li>Second Coming</li><li>Curse of the Mutants</li><li>The Five Lights</li><li>Age of X</li><li>Schism</li><li>Regenesis</li></ul><h2>Original X-Men Spin-Off</h2><h4>X-Men: First Class Vol. 1</h4><p>The original X-Men team; Cyclops, Iceman, Marvel Girl, Beast and Angel, face off new nemesis and team-up with other super heroes.

Later while fighting Sentinels the team recruited Iceman. The Brotherhood of Mutants sent a spy to infiltrate the X-Men group to kill Professor X. They sent Wolverine. Magneto, The Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Toad, Multiple Man, the Blob and Mastermind form the Brotherhood and they had kidnapped the President´s daughter. The X-Men saved her and in the last moment Wolverine had a change of heart and instead of killing Xavier he tried to kill Magneto, while he sent Sentinels to kill humans. In the end Xavier killed Magneto with the help of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.</p><p>Xavier then started helping Wolverine to find out where were the people who gave him the metal implants. Weapon X did all the implants and they found it. Then the X-Men were abducted by Weapon X and were tortured and they even made Beast blue.</p><p>Ultimate Alpha Flight arrived and seemingly kill Iceman and now the X-Men face these strange super powered team. Beast puts Iceman back together but Alpha Flight arrive to take Northstar, something that Colossus isn't very happy about. Alpha Flight was under the influence of a power enhancing drug called Banshee. Taking Northstar had Colossus so mad Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Rouge and him went after Alpha Flight. Cyclops went along to prevent anything stupid from happening. The Acolytes appeared into the picture and caused the death of Northstar. Colossus and the rest of the people who went along went under Banshee drug and enhanced their powers. Dazzler could maneuver her powers to create anything, Rouge could keep the power she absorbed, Nightcrawler could go to greater lengths, Colossus became stronger, and Cyclops could control his eye beams and fly.</p><p>Jean Grey had taken it into her own hands to lead the X-Men and she was driving them around pretty hard. Nightcrawler contacted her saying that they needed help from themselves because they were addicted to the power enhancer. Wolverine had figured out that he was positive to have been dosed with Banshee so he went to Peter Parker for help to sort things out. Kitty and Peter were dealing with Banshee addicts themselves when Wolverine arrived. Peter explained that he was positive because he was Banshee the drug was made by taking properties of him. The X-Men went after the addicted X-Men and fought it off. Jean went off for a moment while she talked to her father as Phoenix when then she fell unconscious. Logan blamed Colossus for it so he took his heart out for it.</p><p>Both X-Men embark on a flight until Phoenix stops it all. Everyone cools down for the exception of Cyclops that flies to the moon. During the fight Wolverine looses a leg to Colossus. Phoenix show to Colossus that Northstar is okay except that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Colossus and Wolverine are fixed up by Jean after that and then Jean heads to the moon. Wolverine using some of the Banshee Colossus bought he tracked it down to Muir Island blaming Xavier for it. Jean talked to Scott and after that he said he wanted to keep the power the Banshee started wearing off so she put his glasses back on. The Prof. was who created Banshee from Wolverine along with Magneto but Moira distributed it. She fought Wolverine with her \"Screaming\" powers. In the end Wolverine destroyed the whole facility. Quicksilver then arrived an told Moira that Magneto had newer plans for the near future.</p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of Captain America, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Rogue and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of Ultimatum so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards. Then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a Sentinel from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverine Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually Scott. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over as Captain America after Steve Rogers aged 100 years, then he died. In the future Iceman was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be Johnny he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, Namor and Firestar.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops´s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. Ben and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met Nihil again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue´s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother´s death. Everyone let the future hero´s free from a prison in the Negative Zone Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-Men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that, that future would not happen.</p><h4>Ultimatum and Beyond</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805942\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805942\"><img alt=\"New generation of X-Men\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New generation of X-Men\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New generation of X-Men</figcaption></figure><p>In Ultimate X-Men #100 we find that The Academy of Tomorrow has been attacked by Madrox on behalf of Magneto.

It is assumed that anyone inside has perished. During Ultimatum, a number of the X-Men are killed, including Dazzler, Nightcrawler and Beast, who die when Magneto's tidal wave hits New York. Magneto then kills Charles by ambushing him in his office and snapping his neck, while Angel is mauled to death by Sabretooth. Wolverine is killed by Magneto during the final battle, and Magneto himself is soon after killed by Cyclops. Cyclops himself is the final victim, dying after Quicksilver sends a bullet through his skull at super speed.</p><p>Following the events of Ultimatum, the remaining X-Men are reduced to a small, scrappy band of survivors. They are forced to contend with a Sentinel attack from William Stryker, Jr. while they fight to stay alive in this new world. For a time, the team is also joined by Johnny Storm, formerly of the Fantastic Four. Their ranks also expand to include Jimmy Hudson, the son of the deceased Wolverine. During this time, the team is also joined by characters Armor and a new mutant named Mach 2, who clashes with Kitty Pryde over leadership.

He lead the X-Men, and members included: Juggernaut, Chamber, Domino, Human Torch and Spider-Woman ( Jessica Drew).</p><h3>X-Men NOIR</h3><p>In this reality (set in the 1930's), the X-Men are a gang of sociopaths (instead of mutants) who were led by the now incarcerated physicist Professor Charles Xavier. Professor Xavier believes sociopath is the next step in human evolution. The X-Men are framed for killing their own member Jean Grey by way of three cuts over the back and face. Leader of the police force known as \" The Brotherhood\" named Magnus is put in charge of the investigation. As the search for the X-Men continues more and more of them are found dead. When a member of the city's police tracks down the X-Men's new leader Scott Summers and is informed that someone is setting them up. When he tells them to go to the police Scott responds. \"We're the X-Men, and no one is on our side\". Meanwhile a mysterious man in a bright red cape is investigating the crimes himself.</p><p>After Warren Worthington is thrown from a roof top and Hank McCoy is shot and killed in a run in with The Brotherhood, Magnus orders the Brotherhood to take down Sebastian Shaw (a powerful mob boss) and his Hellfire Club. Magnus believes with the X-Men out of his way and the Hellfire club killed off, the city will be \"his\". He meets with Anne-Marie Rankin to learn the whereabouts of the last few X-Men but she kills him instead. The caped figure later realizes that Jean Grey is not dead. What happened was that she killed Anne-Marie Rankin and took her place, because she wanted to avoid being studied by Xavier or exploited by Magnus. She then says she knows that the caped figure cannot kill her and pulls a gun on him but he then reveals that he is the twin brother of who she thinks he is and then pushes her off the roof causing them both to fall to their death.</p><p>His twin, accompanied by Scott finds their bodies and says that he lost him years ago by what he had become.

They were, instead, referred to as the Allies for Peace, however the characters all went by their names from the comics and had their original designs from the comics as well.

It also introduced the popular tag feature to the series, with players selecting two characters who could swap out during battle.</p><p>The game proved successful enough to spawn another installment, <em>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</em>, in 1997. Only Wolverine and Omega Red returned as playable characters, while Apocalypse served as the sub-boss. This time, Cyber-Akuma, a version of Akuma who had been transformed into a Horseman of Apocalypse, appeared as the true final boss. <em>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</em>, followed in 1998, with Wolverine and Gambit being the only returning X-Men characters. The plot was loosely adapted from the Onslaught crossover, with Onslaught serving as the final boss. <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em> debuted in 2000, and thanks to upgraded hardware, brought back a massive number of X-Men characters from the past games, including Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Omega Red, Colossus, Rogue, Gambit, Silver Samurai, Sabretooth, Psylocke, Juggernaut, Magneto, Spiral, the Sentinel and Iceman.

The game was released to tie into the first live-action movie, and actually featured the movie costumes as alternate outfits for the characters. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Beast, Gambit and Phoenix appeared as the playable X-Men, while Mystique, Toad, Sabretooth and Magneto showed up as boss characters who could be unlocked. Apocalypse was also featured as a secret character, while Pyro appeared as an exclusive boss character in the Game Boy version. The game was followed by <em>X-Men: Mutant Academy 2</em> in 2001, which added Forge, Havok, Juggernaut, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Rogue, Psylocke and Spider-Man to the cast. When the next generation of game consoles rolled around, Activision released a third and final game in the series, <em>X-Men: Next Dimension</em>, for the PS2. Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Phoenix, Beast, Forge, Gambit, Psylocke, Magneto, Toad, Nightcrawler, Mystique, Rogue, Pyro, Bastion, Dark Phoenix, Betsy (an alternate version of Psylocke with different powers), Bishop, Lady Deathstrike and the Sentinel were all playable. The game had an original story which featured Bastion as the main antagonist.<em> X-Men: Next Dimension</em> was notable for being one of the first games to use the X-Men's then-recent leather outfits from Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's <em>New X-Men</em> run, rather than the Jim Lee-designed outfits that had been used in all of the Capcom fighting games. It was also notable for bringing in Patrick Stewart, the actor who portrayed Professor X in the live-action films, to voice him in the game. The Activision games played similar to the Capcom games, with <em>Next Dimension</em> outright lifting moves from the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series.</p><p>Magneto, Storm and Wolverine also appear in Electronic Arts' 3-D fighting game <i>Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects</i>. Unlike the Capcom and <em>Mutant Academy</em> games, <em>Marvel Nemesis</em> was not very successful upon release. Electronic Arts began work on a new Marvel fighting game (with working titles ranging from <em>Marvel Chaos</em> to simply <em>Marvel</em>). Characters like Wolverine, Phoenix and Juggernaut were planned to appear, but the game was cancelled.</p><p>After Electronic Arts lost the rights to make Marvel games, Capcom was able to release <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</em>, in 2011. Wolverine, Storm, Magneto and the Sentinel returned, while Phoenix, Deadpool and X-23 made their debuts as playable characters.</p><h4>Film-based games</h4><p>To coincide with the release of the third film, Activision has released <i>X-Men: The Official Game</i> which filled in gaps between <i>X2: X-Men United</i> and <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i>, such as explaining Nightcrawler's absence from the third film.</p><h4>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805945\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805945\"><img alt=\"X-Men Legends II\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men Legends II\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men Legends II</figcaption></figure><p>Two role-playing video games entitled <i>X-Men Legends</i> (2004) and <i>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse </i>(2005) were also released to great success.

And unlike his villainous predecessors, the Skull is in complete control of the Chaos energies generated by the Cube - for the people of the world, there will be no awakening from this living nightmare. In order to save the world from Armageddon, one of the X-Men must be willing to risk his, or her, life - an action that will create lasting repercussions not only for the team of uncanny mutants, but for the very fabric of reality itself.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>Written By: Steven A.

It is up to the X-Men, working in uneasy collaboration with Royal Marine Colonel Alysande Stuart, to find a way to repel the Kh'thon invasion of Earth, before terrestrial humans and mutants alike are enslaved by alien masters.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>Written By: Chris Roberson</li><li>Publisher: Pocket Star (April, 2007)</li><li>ISBN-10: 1416510753</li><li>ISBN-13: 978-1416510758</li></ul></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>X-Men: Watcher On the Walls</h4><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134004-x_men_watchers_on_the_walls.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2134004\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6086956521739\" data-width=\"161\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 161px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134004-x_men_watchers_on_the_walls.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2134004\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px\" data-width=\"161\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/2134004-x_men_watchers_on_the_walls.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/2134004-x_men_watchers_on_the_walls.jpg 161w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/2134004-x_men_watchers_on_the_walls.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/2134004-x_men_watchers_on_the_walls.jpg 161w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px\" data-width=\"161\"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><blockquote><p><i>For years, many have believed that the rise of superpowered mutants represents a threat to the survival of ordinary humans.

The first X-Men figures were of Wolverine and Magneto, which were included in Mattel's Secret Wars line. The X-Men got their big break when the Marvel license transferred to ToyBiz, who began producing figures based on the comics. This soon expanded to include the 90s animated series, and the resulting toys proved extremely popular. As time went on, ToyBiz also produced figures for the live-action <em>X-Men</em> movies and the X-Men Evolution cartoon. The X-Men began appearing in ToyBiz's 6-inch Marvel Legends line, and eventually proved popular enough that they fronted their own spin-off line called X-Men Classics.</p><p>The license later transferred to Hasbro, who produced some figures for <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> and <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>, but largely stopped making movie figures based on the franchise after that. The X-Men have continued to appear in Hasbro's Marvel Legends and Marvel Universe lines, and were also featured in the child-oriented Super Hero Squad and Marvel Mashers lines.</p><p>Additionally, throughout the years, many different companies have produced X-Men clothing and apparel. Halloween costumes featuring X-Men characters were also common, especially during the height of the franchise's mainstream prominence during the time the original movies were coming out. Even with the franchise's popularity having peaked some time ago, Wolverine remains a popular Halloween costume choice for children.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6842979\" data-ratio=\"0.79979674796748\" data-width=\"984\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 984px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6842979\"><img alt=\"X-Men Classics by ToyBiz\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 984w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men Classics by ToyBiz\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 984w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men Classics by ToyBiz</figcaption></figure><p>Funko has also produced a selection of X-Men bobbleheads (with the characters also appearing in the company's spin-off lines like Dorbz), while Diamond has featured the X-Men in their Marvel Select and Minimates lines.The X-Men have also been featured in the HeroClix figure game multiple times, and have even been the subject of their own waves.

      "description": "<p>There have been several groups of mutant youths that have utilized the name the Hellions. The Hellions were/are in most cases the antithesis to the junior X-teams such as: the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a>, <a href=\"/generation-x/4060-15083/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15083\">Generation X</a>, the original <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> and most recently the <a href=\"/xavier-institute/4060-40473/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40473\">Xavier Institute</a> squad by the same name as the original, the New Mutants.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> began his quest to put together his second generation team of <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, later dubbed the New Mutants. Initially, being that Xavier Institute was a school, it was simply a means to train young mutants in the use and responsibility of their powers. It evolved into becoming training grounds to become field trained and X-Men ready. The design was simple, in the event that the X-Men were not able to perform the New Mutants would fill the spot, which they eventually did.</p><p>Unbeknown to Xavier, an organization caught wind of his activities and followed quickly after. This group was better known as the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>. The Hellfire Club is a sinister international group of the world's social elite. They are run by mutants that consider themselves superior to other mutants, in both their mutant abilities/powers and social status. They copied Xavier's design perfectly.

She was the headmistress of the school, and it was here that she would train her future Hellions. Her intentions for the Hellions were, when fully trained, they would serve the interest of the Hellfire Club's <a href=\"/the-inner-circle/4005-34656/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34656\">The Inner Circle</a>.</p><p>The Inner Circle seeks to amass absolute power and control, over all things political and economical, through both legal and illegal activities, any means necessary. The Hellions were to be the \"any means necessary.\" As such, Emma needed to seek out and recruit very specific mutants, with abilities that would further aid her organization and later herself.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The success of the New Mutants grew and in the 1984 <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Claremont</a> created an antagonizing team named the Hellions to be the New Mutants nemeses. The Hellions were very similar to the New Mutants and the two teams would go-head-to-head throughout the New Mutants run.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Similar to Professor Xavier, Emma Frost brought together six mutants and made it her duty to shape them into mutants much like herself and the Inner Circle. Her main focus was that she couldn't let anyone get to the mutants before her, especially Xavier. It was then that Emma had a computer, very similar to the original <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a>, created to amplify her mental talents. Once done, her search would begin. Once she located her potential students, she mentally hid their presence from all others until she could recruit them herself.</p><h3>Warpath (James Proudstar)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302341\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\" data-width=\"90\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 90px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302341\"><img alt=\"Warpath\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></a><figcaption>Warpath</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderbird (now known as <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a>): James was the younger brother of the X-Men <a href=\"/thunderbird/4005-2174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2174\">Thunderbird</a>.

He was ruthless, cunning and willing to use his powers on anyone for personal gain. Empath's power (just like his name) was the ability to read, feel and control the emotions of others. He is able to perform this feat on individuals singly or on the city-wide level. Empath was one of Frost's favorites due to their similarities, also one of her biggest pains for the same reason. Empath would be the only member of the Hellions, actually present during their final battle with Fitzroy, to survive and leave the night unscathed. Due, largely in part, to his quick retreat once the Sentinel began their invade.</p><h3>Jetstream (Haroum ibn Sallah al-Rashid)</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302337\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\" data-width=\"90\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 90px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302337\"><img alt=\"Jetstream\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg 90w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jetstream\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jetstream</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/jetstream/4005-2143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2143\">Jetstream</a> shared powers and responsibilities similar to <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a>, who could also propel himself through the air and was also team leader.

When Jetstream would lift off the friction and force of the wind that he would fly through would flay his flesh and also cause severe burns or even catch him on fire. The Hellfire Club would remedy this and provide Jetstream with a bionic system that enabled more control, focus and protection from his powers. As a result, he pledged undying lifelong loyalty to them.</p><h3>Roulette (Jennifer Stavros)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302338\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\" data-width=\"90\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 90px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302338\"><img alt=\"Roulette\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg 90w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Roulette\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roulette</figcaption></figure><p>Born to a casino Poker card dealer in Atlantic City.

Tarot is a precog, with the ability to materialize and animate (purely of psionic energy) tangible, solid representation of the images on her tarot cards. Once created, she had full control of them and they would do battle for her or be used as a transportation device for the team. Her future was to be surrounded in mystery, and more lasting then many of the other Hellion teammates.</p><p>With the final member's acceptance of the White Queen's invitation to the <a href=\"/massachusetts-academy/4020-47788/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47788\">Massachusetts Academy</a>, Emma's search would be over. These young mutants would represent the initial core group, The Hellions.</p><h2>Members come and Go.</h2><p>Others would join to replace members that would leave, or some would be added as ploys. These individuals included:</p><ul><li>The Fiery, on again, off again New Mutant <a href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\">Magma</a> (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla).</li><li>The Bio-electrically charged <a href=\"/bevatron/4005-2141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2141\">Bevatron</a> (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) would fill the slot Firestar would leave open.</li><li>The super strong, not so smart <a href=\"/beef/4005-2139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2139\">Beef</a> (Buford Wilson) would fill Thunderbird's eventual slot.</li><li>One other individual was offered a spot on the team but declined (revealed a lot later in the Marvel Continuity). Older brother of future X-Force member <a href=\"/jesse-bedlam/4005-15329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15329\">Jesse Bedlam</a>/Aaronson, Christopher Terrance Bedlam/Aaronson, later known as <a href=\"/king-bedlam/4005-15576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15576\">King Bedlam</a>. King Bedlam was gifted with the mutant talent to create telepathic static which could control bodily or mental functions, this gave him immunity to mental tampering. When he declined, tried as she might, not even Emma's telepathic persuasion could change his mind. And she tried HARD. Emma didn't take kindly to the word \"No.\" His short time with the team, while making his decision, led to a strong emotional tie with Tarot. They fell in love quickly and, in a still unclear way, the two lovers' souls somehow inextricably became bound together. This would lead to Tarot's later resurrection.</li><li>Finally there was the microwave manipulating, future Avenger <a href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar</a> (Angelica Jones). Emma never had intentions for Firestar to join or be apart of the main group. Emma along with <a href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/4005-8300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, a time traveling mutant from the future, trained her separately and hidden from the others. Firestar was to be the White Queen's personal assassin due to Firestar's destructive and devastating nature of her mutant abilities. Her first mission was to, but never happened, kill the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club (at that time it was <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene</a>) who Emma felt threatened by. This was all for naught as the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> interfered and won the freedom of Firestar, and she joined them instead.</li></ul><h2>The Hellions End.</h2><p>This group of Hellions were together for years, and built a bond that only time could create. They would do battle with many of Marvel's heroes. Though they were created to battle and be enemies with the New Mutants. Through time it simply turned into something similar to a high school rivalry. The Hellions became more then a team, they were a family that most of them were deprived in their normal lives. Unfortunately, all this would be destroyed in one night.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1256866\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55200655200655\" data-width=\"1221\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1221px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1256866\"><img alt=\"Emma Frost and The Hellions\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 1221w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emma Frost and The Hellions\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 1221w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emma Frost and The Hellions</figcaption></figure><p>As a means to lower tension between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, Emma threw a party and invited the X-Men (the Gold team led by <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>). Many of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle were being murdered and Emma felt that if they were targets that the X-Men wouldn't be too far from being the next targets. She wanted the teams to create an alliance, as she felt there was strength in numbers. Animosity between the two teams raged. Old rivalries, coupled with the immaturity of the Hellions egging the X-Men on led to a small skirmish that was quickly brought a halt when two (though at the time they could only see one, the other was using a cloaking device) unknown assailants broke in an attempted to assassinate the Emma. The female assassin immediately lunged at Emma. Emma far too quick, used a telepathic blast to take down her would-be attacker. While the teams regrouped and tried to question the girl/assassin, another attack began, though they had no clue from where. Even <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey's</a> and Emma's vaunted telepathic gifts didn't register the second person.

A huge teleportation gate opens with <a href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\">Donald Pierce</a>, also of the Hellfire Club, running through it with <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a> following. The gate closes and a blood bath ensues. The Sentinels immediately head for Emma, apparently dealing her a killing strike. Empath tries to use his powers to see if she was alive, and runs when he finds that she was dead, or so he thought. The Sentinels decimate most of the Hellions and the X-Men barely get out with their lives. The remaining living Hellions, that didn't die in the fight, would have their life forces drained by Fitzroy, ultimately killing them, so he can open a temporal gate for his teammates to come through.</p><p>Those who were killed in the melee were: Jetstream, Beef, Bevatron, Roulette, Catseye and Tarot. As a side note, at the party there were approximately fifteen other Hellions that are shown but never given a name. It's assumed that Emma had recruited others but were not a part of the main team. They may not have had powers suited for battle, though this is never touched on. What is clear is that all the un-named Hellions would, too, have the life forces drained by Fitzroy. Though it seemed as if Emma was given a mortal blow, she actually did not die, but was put into a coma.</p><p>When she awakens from her coma, she is informed of the death of her students. Grief-stricken and feeling completely responsible for their deaths, something changed in her. Unknown by all, Emma, over the years, grew to love and care for her students, her team of Hellions. The guilt over her loss would lead to her eventual reform. Tarot's story, too, was not over yet either. She is shown later in the page of <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> alive. Tarot would be resurrected, due to her bond with King Bedlam. To be explained in New Hellions section. Other survivors (either because they were not apart of the team or left before the final battle) included: Thunderbird, Empath, Magma and Firestar (although not officially a member).</p><p>Additionally, it was noted in one of the Marvel Handbooks that a come of the New Mutants were members of the Hellions as well. A team of New Mutants were killed then resurrected by the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">Beyonder</a>. When they were brought to like they were mere husks of their former selves. They showed no emotion, being that their deaths affected their psyches greatly. <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> was, at that time, the headmaster at Xavier Institute and also the White King of the Hellfire Club. He made the decision to send the affect students to Emma so that she could provide telepathic therapy to the students. While there, they were enrolled into the Massachusetts Academy and inducted as members of the Hellions, even participating in team training activities. This led to friendship being built between the team. They were: Cannonball, Douglas \"Doug\" Ramsey (<a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Cypher</a>), <a href=\"/illyana-rasputin/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Illyana Rasputin</a> (then Magik), Rahne Sinclair (<a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a>), X'ian Coy Mahn (<a href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\">Karma</a>) and Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla (<a href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\">Magma</a>).</p><p>Once cured of their ailments they quickly returned to <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute</a> as it would be revealed that Magneto's decision to transfer his students was actually due to mental tampering from Empath.

By giving sanctuary to every mutant, they had collected a number of problem children. They rounded them up to be judged and make a decision on their future. Mr. Sinister argued that their psychological issues were tied to their mutant abilities and that the expression of those mutant abilities should be a right every mutant has, especially on Krakoa. The Quiet Council reluctantly agreed and allowed Sinister to put together a team for the most violent of missions. Cyclops wasn't happy about it, especially because his brother, Havok, was put on the team. Havok was still feeling the effects of Scarlet Witch's Axis curse that made him a liability in the field. So, Cyke was able to place Kwannon on the team as a form of mature supervision, much to her chagrin.</p><p>Their first mission: taking out Sinister's old clone lab.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/313712-198363-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313712\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"3.19\" data-width=\"100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:319.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/313712-198363-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313712\"><img alt=\"Age of Apocalypse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/313712-198363-hellions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/313712-198363-hellions.jpg 100w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Age of Apocalypse\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/313712-198363-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/12463/313712-198363-hellions.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Age of Apocalypse</figcaption></figure><p>Though <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> was not apart of the creation, there is a group of Hellions in the <a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/4045-40752/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40752\">AoA</a> timeline.

As anyone might surmise from those four words, Simon Utrecht craved POWER and it wasn't enough that he had already acquired millions of dollars, being a serious industrial competitor of <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> and having held political office, he wanted more! He wanted the might of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and was willing to put his fortune on the line as well as his life and the lives of his three companions to obtain that power, sailing them right into the heart of a Cosmic Storm.</p><p>Tapping the knowledge of , Life-Support Specialist, <a href=\"/vapor/4005-6790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6790\">Ann Darnell</a> and her brother, Fuel Propulsion Engineer, <a href=\"/x-ray/4005-6822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6822\">Jimmy Darnell</a>, Utrecht goads Mike Steel into flying the ship. The Dynamic is now complete with four members ready to set sail to limitless power.</p><p>The sound of the rocket's propulsion wakens <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a> from his crater bed in the near by desert area, where he had been left by the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> after reentering earths atmosphere. Deducing that the rocket configuration and trajectory could only mean space flight, Banner rushed to the mission control room to discover that the ship is headed straight for a cosmic storm, instruments reading radiation levels off the chart. Fearing for their safety Banner reprograms the flight control computer to bring them back before they are killed by radiation poisoning.</p><p>The occupants are bathed in the cosmic radiation, each of them experiencing something unique. Mike expresses that it feels as thought the weight of the ship were on his shoulders, his body somehow bonding with the ships alloy. Jimmy states that he feels aglow with power. Ann melds with the life support systems and Simon is overwhelmed by a mass of data somehow connected to the ships computers, as if he were vectoring towards the stars themselves. The rocket returns crashing to earth with such a crushing explosion that Banner fears nothing could have survived the impact.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-555951\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.544\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-555951\"><img alt=\"U-Foes Emerge\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg 621w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" data-width=\"621\"></a><figcaption>U-Foes Emerge</figcaption></figure><p>Much to Banner's surprise, four beings emerge from the wreckage with incredible powers.</p><p><b><a href=\"/vector/4005-6820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6820\">Vector</a>:</b> (Simon Utrecht) has the ability to vector/repel any object no matter it's weight size or density.</p><p><b><a href=\"/vapor/4005-6790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6790\">Vapor</a>:</b> (Ann Darnell) Exhibits the ability to change her form into any gaseous mixture she imagines.</p><p><b><a href=\"/x-ray/4005-6822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6822\">X-Ray</a>:</b> (Jimmy Darnell) Commands radiation of all classifications and can project them offensively.</p><p><b><a href=\"/ironclad/4005-6821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6821\">Ironclad</a>:</b> (Mike Steel) Emerges with a metallic hide, the ability to control his density and Hulk class strength.</p><p>Immediately the quartet blame Banner for robbing them of even greater power by having brought them back too early.

But we have attained the power which we sought!\"</p><p>While pummeling Banner and continuing the blame game, Ironclad uses his cosmic irradiated logic to title the quartet the U-Foes.

Each member demonstrates a level of selfishness while trying to work as a team, catching Ironclad in friendly fire. While having the ability to defeat the giant green brute, ultimately the U-Foes end up defeating themselves as their increasing powers get the better of them, becoming uncontrollable. <a href=\"/vapor/4005-6790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6790\">Vapor</a> unable to maintain her atomic structure dissipates into the air. <a href=\"/vector/4005-6820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6820\">Vector</a> suffocates himself as he unwillingly pushes away even the smallest air molecule and pushes himself away from the earth into the outer atmosphere. <a href=\"/x-ray/4005-6822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6822\">X-Ray</a> is unable to control the radiation combination, explodes in the sky and <a href=\"/ironclad/4005-6821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6821\">Ironclad</a>'s mass density get so heavy that he sinks into the ground working his way towards the earth's core.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The U-Foes were created by <a href=\"../../bill-mantlo/26-42478/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"../../sal-buscema/26-12717/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sal Buscema</a> in 1980 and first appeared in <a href=\"../../the-incredible-hulk/49-2406/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Incredible Hulk</a> # 254.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Of course this was not the end of the U-Foes. The team has tried to get revenge on the Hulk a multitude of times after their initial incarnation.

Simon shares a romantic relationship with Ann much in the same way that Reed and Sue have but without the wedlock and the super powered offspring.

Prof. Utrecht is a ruthless business man as well as being a Professor. Utrecht convinces three other people to join him in his quest to recreate Dr. Banners experiment. In the game Banner says he was tempted to go and speak to him when he first began working on the project. The army realizes what Utrecht is doing and sends a group of soldiers to arrest go an arrest him. Playing as the Hulk you must reach them and destroy them before they get to Utrecht because Banner needs to talk to him. A man named Rick Jones is an alley with you and radios you and tells you that there is a gamma radiation level coming from the top of Utrecht's apartment and if you don't destroy the dish then it could be a very bad thing for the city. Still playing as the Hulk you must rush to the apartment and destroy the satellite dish that is drawing the gamma energy. After doing so a small cut scene of the Hulk destroying the rest of the building shows and then the ufoes stand up and are amazed with the Hulk but decide he is a threat to them and he must be stopped. They will come at you by twos and try to kill you. They have all renamed themselves, Utrecht has named himself Vector. The others are named Vapor,Ironclad, and X-Ray. After finally defeating them a video will play of Vector promising that if the Hulk ever interferes again he must be killed. You will meet them randomly throughout the city later on.</p><p>In the 2012 turn based RPG social network game, Avengers Ultimate Alliance, the U-Foes are reoccurring enemies in chapter 4: You, Foe.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Rising out of the fall of the Axis Powers in World War II, HYDRA was apparently created as a secret organization for global domination by Nazi spymaster <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Baron Wolfgang von Strucker</a> along with <a href=\"/kraken/4005-60717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60717\">Kraken</a>. This developed with the help of an alliance with <a href=\"/shoji-soma/4005-76602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76602\">Shoji Soma</a>, grandmaster of the <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\">Hand</a>. When the power base pf HYDRA felt firmly established, Strucker installed himself as its supreme commander and ended the alliance with the Hand.</p><blockquote data-align=\"right\"><p>\"Hail Hydra! Immortal Hydra! We shall never be destroyed! Cut off a limb, and two more shall take its place!\"</p></blockquote><p>HYDRA recruited from the remnants of the Nazi's military forces and acquired alien technologies to advance its resources beyond those that most governments possessed. Strucker chose to build HYDRA\"s forces quietly over the following decades.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hydra was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>. The first appearance of Hydra was in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/strange-tales-135-the-man-for-the-job/4000-111069/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-111069\">Strange Tales #135</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Through the decades, HYDRA was consistently used as a source of all-purpose terrorism and villainous cannon fodder with its legions of uniformed operatives and its philosophy \"cut off one head and two will take its place.\" It also consistently served as an opposite number for <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, Marvel's source of all-purpose espionage and heroic cannon fodder.</p><p>A number of other criminal organizations began as branches of HYDRA before striking off as their own independent entities, such as <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a>, with its own various factions, and separate incarnations of the <a href=\"/secret-empire/4060-15136/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15136\">Secret Empire</a>.</p><p>Baron Von Strucker has most commonly depicted as HYDRA's \"Supreme Hydra.\" However, the organization fractured after his first death, leading to a variety of HYDRAs with an inconsistent hierarchy of leadership. This continued even after Strucker was resurrected and he supposedly reunited HYDRA. Others claiming the title of Supreme Hydra have included <a href=\"/viper/4005-3420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\">Viper</a> and <a href=\"/gorgon/4005-3777/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3777\">the Gorgon</a>.</p><p>This was addressed in <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4050-25640/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25640\"><i>Secret Warriors</i></a> by <a href=\"/jonathan-hickman/4040-45065/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-45065\">Jonathan Hickman</a>, who introduced the <a href=\"/hydra-high-council/4060-58039/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58039\">HYDRA High Council</a>. This embraced the sometimes inconsistent portrayals of HYDRA by rationalizing it as HYDRA now having a council-based leadership that including Von Strucker, Viper, Gorgon, <a href=\"/the-hive/4005-60718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60718\">the Hive</a>, Kraken and a new <a href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegro-de-la-fontaine/4005-23797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23797\">Madame Hydra</a>. The structure of HYDRA was much more strongly defined through the course of this series but also heavily changed in the end due to an internal civil war. Much of the High Council was left either dead or defected, leaving HYDRA under the command of Gorgon and Madame HYDRA. The end of this series also revealed the role of Von Strucker's arch-foe, <a href=\"/\">Nick Fury</a>, in the birth of the organization.</p><p>Additionally, an extradimensional rift has allowed agents of HYDRA from an alternate Earth to appear on Earth-616. This version of the organization is firmly under the command of <a href=\"/\">Queen Hydra</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/enemy-of-the-state/4045-55965/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55965\">Enemy of the State</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-265233\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-265233\"><img alt=\"Wolverine vs. Gorgon\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Wolverine vs. Gorgon</figcaption></figure><p>In an alliance between HYDRA and the Hand, Baron Von Strucker orchestrated a plan that saw <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> taken and killed by the Gorgon. Wolverine was then resurrected by the Hand's magic as a loyal agent of HYDRA. Wolverine was then sent on a killing spree in the superhuman and law enforcement communities in the service of HYDRA. Some of these superhumans were made into HYDRA agents using the same Hand magic that was used on Wolverine. Along the way, he also acquired defense secrets and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a>' technology for HYDRA. He was eventually brought down by a combined effort from the superhero community and freed of HYDRA's brainwashing. Despite this, HYDRA still accomplished a great deal.</p><p>All was not well within HYDRA, though. The Gorgon had entered into an affair with <a href=\"/elisbeth-von-strucker/4005-4661/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4661\">Elsbeth Von Strucker</a>, Baron Von Strucker's wife, and used this to depose him as the Supreme Hydra. Both HYDRA and the Hand were now under the Gorgon's command, and he focused on the part of Von Strucker's plan involving using the Hand's magic to recruit superhumans. He ordered the mass murder of both superheroes and supervillains alike so that their bodies could be revived as loyal HYDRA agents, quickly gathering together a small army.</p><p>However, S.H.I.E.L.D. had successfully deprogrammed Wolverine, and the mutant now wanted nothing but revenge. He tore through the Hand and Gorgon's former death cult, the Dawn of the White Light. He then came after Gorgon as he was carrying out a plan to assassinate Nick Fury.

Ironically, HYDRA was dealing with its own infiltrators around the same time, namely the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a>. Upon realization that he had been breached by the Skrulls, Strucker chose to completely destroyed his undersea base codenamed Ichor with all of its personnel. He then reconvened HYDRA at Gehenna, their most treasured stronghold, and called the full HYDRA High Council together. They even forced the Grandmaster of the Hand to resurrect the Gorgon to convene the full council of HYDRA's leaders.</p><p>So it was that Baron Strucker, Kraken, the Hive, the Gorgon, Madame Hydra and the Viper all met together for what was apparently the first time, and Strucker laid out his intentions. Fury had discovered their true structure and was going to come for them. Rather than wait, he wanted HYDRA to go to war with Fury. Though some were reluctant, there was unanimous consent for Strucker's war.</p><h3>Wake the Beast</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/wake-the-beast/4045-56433/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56433\">Wake the Beast</a></p><p>HYDRA was betrayed by one of its leaders Madame Hydra, actually Contessa Allegro de la Fontaine. She was, in fact, a sleeper agent of <a href=\"/leviathan/4060-57417/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57417\">Leviathan</a>, an ancient enemy of HYDRA's dating back to the years of its very formation. She acquired from them an alien power source that could be used to awaken Leviathan's leader from stasis, and so rose <a href=\"/orion/4005-70203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70203\">Orion</a>, leader of Leviathan. The two organizations met for what HYDRA hoped could be an understanding between them. Leviathan was not interested in any understanding, and so fierce war began between Leviathan and HYDRA.</p><p>All the while, Nick Fury and his small force of <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\">Secret Warriors</a> manipulated events to urge them on.</p><h3>Wheels Within Wheels</h3><p>HYDRA took heavy losses in the war with Leviathan, and this was made worse when Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors successfully destroyed Gehenna. The loss of this stronghold fractured HYDRA's leadership, and two factions clashed in an internal civil war. One side rallied behind the Gorgon and the other behind Kraken. This only increased HYDRA's losses, and it turned out this was all carefully orchestrated by Nick Fury. Kraken was not the original man who helped create HYDRA but was actually Jake Fury. HYDRA had been played into killing itself, and Nick Fury personally executed Strucker.</p><p>Though diminished, HYDRA managed to endure because Fury had not accounted in his plans for Gorgon's resurrection. What remained of HYDRA gathered un his and Viper's leadership.</p><h2>Ultimate</h2><p>Spider-Man saved Tony Stark from an attack by HYDRA.

      "deck": "A U.N. affiliated intelligence agency dealing primarily with terrorism and superhuman threats that was originally founded by the U.S. government.",
      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. was formed by <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury,</a> in the period after <a href=\"/world-war-ii/4015-56025/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56025\">World War II</a>. However, he figured the U.S. government wouldn't want a group like that, so he disbanded it. Later, though, after a terrorist attack, he noticed that a group like S.H.I.E.L.D. could really have helped and prevented the disaster. So he reformed it. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"/united-nations/4060-57235/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57235\">United Nations</a> had already taken S.H.I.E.L.D. and restarted it, having Colonel <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/rick-stoner/4005-83583/\">Rick Stoner</a> becoming the first Director of the organization. Fury immediately joined and rose to the top. The Nations had reformed it in response to a <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> attack, and once Fury was leading it, it flourished.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. made their first appearance in <a href=\"/strange-tales/4050-18066/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18066\">Strange Tales</a> #135. They were created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jack Kirby.</a></p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate) or Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law enforcement Division (see Iron Man #227) is a group affiliated with the U.N that deals with superhuman threats. It is an intelligence and anti-terrorism group similar to the <a href=\"/federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi/4060-55443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\">FBI</a>, only it is an international corporation that spans all the world. It acts like the police force. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are armed and work well, much more effective then standard police. They fight terrorists as well as super humans. S.H.I.E.L.D. also has been responsible for the starting of spin-off groups like <a href=\"/sword/4060-41666/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41666\">S.W.O.R.D.</a> and <a href=\"/strike/4060-58524/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58524\">S.T.R.I.K.E.</a> S.H.I.E.L.D. has agents that also are higher level, that often are super humans. <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"/spider-woman/4005-1453/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman</a>, and <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> all have operated as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps ties to the superhuman community, too-they often call on the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, and <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. has superhuman agents in the past-two teams were formed in an effort to make a S.H.I.E.L.D. superhuman team. The first team consisted of Marvel Man, <a href=\"/texas-twister/4005-10214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10214\">Texas Twister</a>, the <a href=\"/vamp/4005-14409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14409\">Vamp</a>, and <a href=\"/blue-streak/4005-14446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14446\">Blue Streak</a>. However, it quickly failed, and another team in the same vein also failed. The Psi-Division of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a group of psychics or telepaths that deal with psionic menaces. This is only one of the groups of super humans that work in S.H.I.E.L.D. for the greater good.</p><p>All S.H.I.E.L.D. members have a certain level, based on their importance. A normal S.H.I.E.L.D. agent will have a Level One-which means he can pass through Level One areas and has clearance. A sergeant might have Level Two, which means he has Level Two and One clearance. The Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. has a Level Nine clearance. Level Ten means the most important person in the world-no one currently possesses a Level Ten clearance. Not even the President, or Nick Fury.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. has many bases around the world. Many are on land-most notably S.H.I.E.L.D. Central, which is located in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a>. There are also many shelters that are secretly placed around the world. Fury has used one, as has the <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a> when they needed a base during the events of Civil War. However, their most famous and important base is the <a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">Helicarrier</a></h3><p>The Helicarrier is an aircraft that is constantly in the air. It is huge enough to hold an aircraft carrier. It is the mobile headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. and is extremely protected. The Helicarrier has held an entire squadron of jet fighters and a nuclear ballistic missile. There is one major Helicarrier, which is the one that is most important and used. There are also many smaller Helicarriers, however, which all serve as bases too. The Helicarrier has an extremely high level of security-even if someone managed to get on without clearance, guards and extremely powerful security technology would have them gone in a second. The Helicarrier was first proposed by <a href=\"/stark-industries/4060-56840/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56840\">Stark Industries</a>, and was designed by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a>, and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. operated as a covert, military/intelligence agency at the time, and members of it had already appeared. S.H.I.E.L.D. already fought HYDRA then-the evil group had plots like the aforementioned \"Overkill Horn\". <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a> made its first appearance, and individual villains such as <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> also popped up and needed to be stopped by S.H.I.E.L.D.. At this time, Godzilla came, and the <a href=\"/godzilla-squad/4060-57924/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57924\">Godzilla Squad</a> was formed to take the monster down. S.H.I.E.L.D. had tough periods during this time. Several lifelike robots got so smart that they became able to think and make choices-they became sentient beings. They had a grudge against S.H.I.E.L.D. for making them follow orders all the time before they had intelligence-so they drugged important S.H.I.E.L.D. members and took their place within the organization. Several of these were <a href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegra-de-la-fontaine/4005-23797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23797\">Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine</a>, <a href=\"/jimmy-woo/4005-7530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7530\">Jimmy Woo</a>, and <a href=\"/jasper-sitwell/4005-7529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7529\">Jasper Sitwell</a>, among others. However, the valiant Fury managed to take them down.</p><h3>Fury's Influence</h3><p>Most of the reason that S.H.I.E.L.D. was so effective started with <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Fury</a>. He started the group and put good, effective agents in place. He was extremely popular in and out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and had strong ties with the hero community. Without him, many \"pessimists\" and intellectuals theorized that S.H.I.E.L.D. would fall, and fall hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were right. S.H.I.E.L.D. ran into disastrous times. As aforementioned, Nick Fury did a mission in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a> to stop them from attacking the U.S. However, it was totally unauthorized, and Fury was forced to resign from S.H.I.E.L.D. Warrants went out for his arrest. The new head of S.H.I.E.L.D. was <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a>-who proved to be incompetent at the position. The President of the U.S. was a driving force behind Hill's election-for two reasons. Hill was an American, so the President expected her to be loyal first and foremost to the U.S. even though S.H.I.E.L.D. was a United Nations facility. Also, many men and women had been members of S.H.I.E.L.D. for a long time, and they would have been much better as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.. However, they were \"too loyal to Fury\", so Hill got the job to keep the Fury loyalists out.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. took a downward turn. Fury's work as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. was extremely effective, and an insane amount of work had kept corruption out of the huge organization. Unfortunately, Hill wasn't as good as Fury at it, and S.H.I.E.L.D. became corrupt and weak. Crimes were committed. Criminals were \"stockpiled\" in prison. Worst of all, the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> discovered that someone was mining the anti-metal in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a> using slave labor-and S.H.I.E.L.D. was the prime suspect.</p><h3>Subdivisions</h3><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. also has many subdivisions and other groups based off it. Two other groups have been formed from S.H.I.E.L.D.; <a href=\"../../sword/65-41666/\" rel=\"nofollow \">S.W.O.R.D</a>.,<a href=\"/safe/4020-56459/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56459\">S.A.F.E.</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/armor/4060-53864/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53864\">A.R.M.O.R</a>. .</p><p>S.W.O.R.D. stands for Sentient World Observation and Response Department. As you can easily guess, S.W.O.R.D. works with extraterrestrials. It stops extraterrestrial threats, keeps tabs on powerful aliens, etc. They are not a subdivision of S.H.I.E.L.D. but are actually a separate, yet similar group that simply works with S.H.I.E.L.D. However, they are closely affiliated with both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United Nations. S.W.O.R.D. encountered <a href=\"/ord/4005-4445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4445\">Ord</a>, an alien who was convinced that a mutant from Earth was destined to destroy his planet. He attempted to attack Earth to kill all the mutants but S.W.O.R.D. and the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow \">X-Men</a> stopped him, effectively stopping an interplanetary war. The leader of S.W.O.R.D. is <a href=\"../../abigail-brand/29-4441/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Abigail Brand</a>, a tough, effective leader who stopped many crises and is extremely valuable to S.H.I.E.L.D. She was a Fury loyalist and respected him a lot and greatly dislikes Maria Hill. As for Tony Stark, he has not encountered S.W.O.R.D. or Brand yet. S.W.O.R.D. is currently trying to stop another war with a planet called <a href=\"/breakworld/4020-42278/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42278\">Breakworld</a>.</p><p>Since S.H.I.E.L.D. is loyal to the United Nations two countries have created their own answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. that works within their country and their country alone. The first to appear was the British version of S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href=\"/strike/4060-58524/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58524\">S.T.R.I.K.E.</a> (Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies). S.T.R.I.K.E. was British, but one of their early leaders, Tod Radcliffe, was revealed to be a traitor that worked for the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>. The next leader was <a href=\"/lance-hunter/4005-9122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9122\">Lance Hunter</a>. They worked closely with <a href=\"../../captain-britain/29-7477/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Captain Britain</a>. However, <a href=\"/vixen/4005-14890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14890\">Vixen</a> (Captain Britain's enemy) took them over and S.T.R.I.K.E. was disbanded. The most prominent person to work for S.T.R.I.K.E. was <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Betsy Braddock</a>, who had psychic powers. After leaving S.T.R.I.K.E.. she joined the X-Men as the heroine Psylocke.</p><p>S.A.F.E. is the United States answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. The name stands for Strategic Action For Emergencies. S.A.F.E. is nearly identical to S.H.I.E.L.D., except they are only in the U.S. They have fought many enemies, including <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> and <a href=\"../../baron-heinrich-zemo/29-3708/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a>. The leader is Sean Morgan, a competent leader and good soldier. Joshua Ballard is the most prolific agent, and he's extremely helpful-he's the <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> of S.A.F.E..</p><p>Along with these agencies, other small groups have been formed including Euromind and Starcore.</p><p>Another group that has continually showed up over the years is the Cape Killers. They were never an official S.H.I.E.L.D. group, but S.H.I.E.L.D. agents did make up it's ranks. The term Cape Killers was given to any group of soldiers trained to hunt, subdue and in worst case scenario kill meta humans. The Cape Killers have had such members as <a href=\"/agent-abrams/4005-68471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68471\">Agent Abrams</a>, Agent Cleery, <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a>, &amp; Special Agent Marquez, and her partner Agent McAllister.</p><h3>Members</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-916245\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.54375\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-916245\"><img alt=\"Nick Fury\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Nick Fury</figcaption></figure><p>The most prominent, important, and effective member of S.H.I.E.L.D. is the man who runs it all, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>. Fury was born in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a> in 1921, to decorated <a href=\"/world-war-i/4015-56026/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56026\">World War I</a> pilot Jack Fury. He and his friend <a href=\"/red-hargrove/4005-5178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5178\">Red Hargrove</a> lusted after adventure-so they joined the U.S. Army in <a href=\"/world-war-ii/4015-56025/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56025\">World War II</a>. Nick was an adept soldier, and he was given command of the First Attack Squad-nicknamed the <a href=\"/howling-commandos/4060-32653/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32653\">Howling Commandos</a>. The Howling Commandos were extremely effective-and Fury quickly became a decorated war hero.</p><p>After the war, Fury was hit by a land mine and badly injured. The government decided to test a new formula on him-that would heal him and greatly retard his aging. This was called the <a href=\"/infinity-formula/4015-43534/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43534\">Infinity Formula</a>. It worked-Fury was restored to full strength and is still in his physical prime today. He eventually joined the CIA and became a CIA agent in Korea, also interacting with the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> hired him to be the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury excelled at the job. Under his leadership, S.H.I.E.L.D. grew and grew until it is now one of the most powerful organizations in the world. Fury led S.H.I.E.L.D. for over forty years, working tirelessly and keeping it powerful and secret.</p><p>However, Fury recently discovered that <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, led by the evil <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, was planning to attack America. He immediately had S.H.I.E.L.D. launch a covert assault on the country, effectively stopping the massive attack that would have taken place. A year later, Latveria attacked back, and thousands were killed. Fury was blamed-and <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a> was injured. <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> was angered at Fury. Eventually, this culminated in Fury being fired as commander of S.H.I.E.L.D.. A warrant was put out for his arrest, and <a href=\"/\">Maria Hill</a> took his place as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Hill still leads S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury is still in hiding. He keeps control over parts of S.H.I.E.L.D. and lent a base to the <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a> during <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>.</p><p>Nick Fury is infused with the Infinity Formula, meaning he barely ages at all. He is an soldier, with lots of experience as both a warrior and a leader. He is a master tactician and strategist, and is very good with all sorts of weapons. He wields great political power as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., and is a very good hand-to-hand combatant.</p><p>Nick Fury is not the only S.H.I.E.L.D. agent-not by a long shot. Many of the other important S.H.I.E.L.D. members date back from Fury's old team-the Howling Commandos.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141426\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.796\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141426\"><img alt=\"Dum Dum Dugan\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Dum Dum Dugan</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dum Dum Dugan</a> (Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader Dugan) was working as a circus strongman before he enlisted in World War II. He was put in the Howling Commandos, a new division led by Nick Fury. He was extremely valuable to the team-he was so strong that he was able to save them from many things that should have killed them. He was a great marksman, strongman, and leader, and he became Fury's second-in-command. When the war ended, Fury invited Dugan into S.H.I.E.L.D. as his second-in-command. Dugan has easily been the second-most-important person to S.H.I.E.L.D. His missions have included tracking down and killing a radioactive monster ( <a href=\"/\">Godzilla</a>, in the <a href=\"/godzilla-squad/4060-57924/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57924\">Godzilla Squad</a>) and various independent missions to take super villains (often with <a href=\"/squirrel-girl/4005-2488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2488\">Squirrel Girl</a>). For a long time, he worked maintaining security on the Helicarrier, and working for Fury whenever needed. When Fury was replaced by Maria Hill, he was her second-in-command and was put in charge of mutant affairs. This involved conflicts with <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, who he had a mysterious contact with. Eventually, he tried to resign from S.H.I.E.L.D. when Tony Stark took control. He was rejected-he was too important to S.H.I.E.L.D. to quit. He was recently shot in the chest by <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a>, but he survived, and is currently in the hospital.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-804114\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0127118644068\" data-width=\"236\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-804114\"><img alt=\"Gabriel Jones\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg 236w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gabriel Jones\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gabriel Jones</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"../../gabriel-jones/29-13836/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gabriel Jones</a> was a young African-American living in <a href=\"/\">New York City</a> when a little thing called World War II popped up.

As a young girl, Sharon loved hearing stories of her older sister Peggy, who was a World War 1 flying ace and freedom fighter. Peggy had worked with Captain America, and the two fell in love. However, Cap never learned her name, and he then froze in suspended animation. Sharon was a good fighter and loved justice, so she joined S.H.I.E.L.D. under the code-name \"Agent 13\" and ran out several missions for them. She kept crossing paths with Cap, who had been resurrected and they eventually fell in love. Cap wanted her to quit as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but she refused. Eventually, her death was faked so she could be sent off on a top-secret mission. The mission failed, and she was presumed dead. Cap was never informed that her death was faked the first time. However, he eventually found her, and she rejoined S.H.I.E.L.D.. She now works as a high-level agent, reporting directly to Hill for missions. Recently, she was given a hypnotic suggestion by <a href=\"/doctor-faustus/4005-34185/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34185\">Dr. Faustus</a> to help kill Captain America, and under hypnotism, shot him in the stomach after <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\">Crossbones</a>, a sniper and <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull's</a> henchman, shot him.

Most of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemies are big groups-and the most powerful, fearsome, and deadly one of them all is HYDRA. HYDRA is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s archenemy. The motto of the group is \"Cut off one of our heads, and two more will take it's place!\" This is a reference to the Ancient Greek monster called the hydra, which fought <a href=\"../../hercules/29-2503/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hercules</a> and had the same ability. HYDRA is a terrorist group dedicated to taking over the world and destroying S.H.I.E.L.D., which has foiled them many a time.</p><p>HYDRA has actually been around for centuries. The group goes all the way back to Imperial Japan, which only sought to rule Japan. This all changed in the 1900s when <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Wolfgang Von Strucker</a> joined the group. Strucker was insane, deluded, and powerful-and he quickly rose to the top of the group. he steered it away from Japan and decided on a new goal-rule the world! When he got to the top, he changed his name and got a title-he became Baron Strucker. HYDRA was originally very open, not quiet, and S.H.I.E.L.D. was actually specifically formed to fight it (as you will read later). HYDRA and S.H.I.E.L.D. became enemies-constantly warring to take each other down. HYDRA made several daring moves. Strucker invented the \"Overkill Horn\", which would detonate all nuclear explosives worldwide. Later came the biological \"Death-Spore Bomb\". Both plots were foiled by S.H.I.E.L.D., and the latter resulted in Strucker's death.</p><p>After Baron Strucker died, HYDRA split into many mini-groups, or \"heads\" of HYDRA. Some of these were East Coast HYDRA, Las Vegas HYDRA, New York HYDRA, and Germany HYDRA. These factions also genetically created super agents for HYDRA, resulting in the creation of many villains. However, this backfired when the great hero Spider-Woman was created by HYDRA related. Eventually Strucker was revived, and he reunited HYDRA. They continued their war against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Earth.</p><p>HYDRA later planned a massive attack on the U.S-they smuggled nuclear missile into America and was going to launch a bio nuclear assault on a major aquifer. They also tried to brainwash an army of heroes and villains (including <a href=\"../../elektra/29-1802/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Northstar</a>). Both times, they were foiled by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the <a href=\"../../new-avengers/65-42520/\" rel=\"nofollow \">New Avengers</a> (including Spider-Woman, who they created). HYDRA is still extremely dangerous, and cannot be stopped easily. The only reason they don't currently rule the world is because of the heroic efforts of S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><p>The HYDRA Agent is similar to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. He is extremely well-trained-only the elite become agents. They carry a large variety of weapons and are trained especially in stealth. HYDRA Agents often get missions to detonate, destroy, beat up, or burn things, and they are superb fighters. Some Agents of HYDRA have been <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>, <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kingpin</a>, and many others.</p><h3><a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a></h3><p>Although HYDRA is easily S.H.I.E.L.D.'s greatest enemy, it is by no means the only one. One of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s other enemies is A.I.M.</p><p>A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) was created as a subdivision of HYDRA, by Baron Strucker. A.I.M.'s purpose was to create new technological wonders for HYDRA to use against S.H.I.E.L.D. and to take over the world. It is a group of scientists, industrialists, and technological geniuses, and originally, they provided and designed weapons, defenses, and huge assault mechanisms for HYDRA. However, HYDRA suffered a huge defeat from the U.S and Japan Armies, so A.I.M. broke off into it's own group. Like HYDRA, A.I.M.'s goal is to rule the Earth. However, unlike HYDRA, who wants to do it by force, A.I.M. seeks domination by technological means. They have created huge weapons and marvels before, and share one trait with HYDRA-they are dedicated to destroying S.H.I.E.L.D.. A.I.M. was led by the <a href=\"/scientist-supreme/4015-55957/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55957\">Scientist Supreme</a>, an evil, shadowy figure where very little about him is known by S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><p>The <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cosmic Cube</a> was an intensely powerful item as it could literally alter reality to the user's whim. Red Skull once stole it and wreaked havoc with it, but that was later. The Cube was created by the scientists at A.I.M., who sought to use it to rule the world. However, the Cube actually evolved into a new creature, <a href=\"../../kubik/29-20022/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kubik</a>, and A.I.M. no longer controls it. In this vein, A.I.M. created the <a href=\"../../super-adaptoid/29-10861/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super-Adaptoid</a>, which could exactly mimic the powers and appearance of other superheroes and villains. Although it was immensely powerful, the Adaptoid contained a sliver of the Cosmic Cube that gave it its power. When the Cube became Kubik, it wanted the shard back, so it easily destroyed the creature and regained the sliver. A.I.M. also created <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">M.O.D.O.K.</a> (Mobile Organism Designed Only for Killing). M.O.D.O.K. was originally one of AIM's own scientists, and he took control of A.I.M. and improved it, continuing the fight to rule the world and destroy S.H.I.E.L.D.. M.O.D.O.K. still is in charge of A.I.M. Along with A.I.M., some of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemies are <a href=\"../../zodiac/65-41170/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Zodiac</a> and Godzilla.</p><p>Zodiac is a criminal organization that was created using S.H.I.E.L.D. technology. Each member is another sign of the Zodiac, and they are dedicated to world domination. Although the Zodiac mostly fights the Avengers, they often collide with S.H.I.E.L.D. in their efforts to have the world ruled by their criminal organization.</p><p>Godzilla was a radioactive monster that rose out of the waters of Tokyo, Japan. S.H.I.E.L.D. immediately responded to the crisis, and formed the Godzilla Squad out of some of its members. The Squad was led by Dum Dum Dugan (who never fully recovered from the experience), and its mission was to take down Godzilla! Godzilla caused lots of property damage around Asia and North America before it was finally driven back into the sea. Obviously, this is based on the Japanese movie in real life of the same name-minus the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a></h3><p>The Civil War started when the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> (consisting of <a href=\"/speedball/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Robbie Baldwin</a>, <a href=\"/namorita/4005-2113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2113\">Namorita</a>, <a href=\"/microbe/4005-40859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40859\">Microbe</a>, and <a href=\"/night-thrasher/4005-2098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2098\">Night Thrasher</a>) went on a basic mission to catch four criminals in an old house. They included <a href=\"/speedfreek/4005-25735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25735\">Speedfreek</a> and an old <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a> villain- <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a>. These villains had escaped from <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft</a> when <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a> broke them out. The New Warriors easily defeated the villains-but Nitro was escaping. Namorita stopped him, but he let off an explosion, destroying <a href=\"/stamford-ct/4020-45571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45571\">Stamford</a> and murdering 600 people.</p><p><a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, also known as Iron Man, proposed the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Superhuman Registration Act</a>, where all super humans would have to register their powers and identities. They'd basically be cops. <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a>, who was the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. supported the Act, and eventually it was passed. Many super humans disagreed with the Act, the most important and prolific being <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. S.H.I.E.L.D. was enlisted by the U.S. government-take down Cap and his anti-registration hero team, the <a href=\"/\">Secret Avengers</a>. New S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents, nicknamed cape-killers, went after anti-reg heroes. S.H.I.E.L.D. was led by Maria Hill, and was fully pro-reg. Iron Man worked closely with S.H.I.E.L.D. also-he revealed his identity as Tony Stark. Many battles were fought. Eventually, Tony Stark's pro-registration side-and S.H.I.E.L.D. won. However, Maria Hill found out why she had been made the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., as aforementioned-to keep more effective \"Fury loyalists\" out and be loyal to the U.S. She was not supposed to be effective, and she wasn't. Dismayed, she turned leadership of S.H.I.E.L.D. over to the man she thought deserved it most-Tony Stark. Stark, also Iron Man, is currently the leader and head of S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><h3><a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a></h3><p>In the fallout of Secret Invasion <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> is granted the keys to the whole world and closes down S.H.I.E.L.D. and replaces it with his own special forces known as <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> He also replaces all of the organization's <a href=\"/stark-industries/4060-56840/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56840\">Stark</a> Tech (which had been compromised during the <a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\"><em>Secret Invasion</em></a>) with technology and weapons created by <a href=\"/osborn-industries/4060-58700/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58700\">Oscorp</a>.</p><p>Nick Fury also discovers a dark secret about who as been pulling S.H.I.E.L.D.'s strings the whole time he was an agent in <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\"><em>Secret Warriors</em> </a>#1.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. has a lot of technology, important technology that is often used. Perhaps the most important is the LMD- <a href=\"../../life-model-decoy/18-42286/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Life Model Decoy</a>. The Life Model Decoy is an android that is absolutely indistinguishable from whoever it impersonates. Fingerprints, DNA, hair, speech, thought patterns (for telepaths), anything, the Decoy is exactly the same. However, it is an android. LMDs are used to duplicate people and take their place if they are going to be assassinated or there is a strong chance of an attack. LMDs have been used in place of personnel since the beginning of the organization, including Jessica Drew. Most often, they have been used as a substitute for Nick Fury, who has had at least five LMDs destroyed in attempts to have him killed. These robots are a lot of the reason that many key S.H.I.E.L.D. members are still alive. The <a href=\"/zodiac/4060-41170/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41170\">Zodiac</a>, a criminal organization, was created using stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. LMDs. Also, LMDs have gained sentience a few times. The <a href=\"/deltites/4060-59033/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59033\">Deltites</a> were a group of LMDs that gained sentience and tried to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D.. They were narrowly defeated by Nick Fury.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. also has used robot exoskeletons and gargantuan robots to achieve its ends. <a href=\"../../red-ronin/29-33761/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Red Ronin</a> is the most important of those. Red Ronin was a huge, super powerful robot that was used by the Godzilla Squad. The robot was destroyed by Godzilla before he was driven into the sea. It was rebuilt, but was hijacked by a mad scientist who was trying to start World War Three. It was stopped by the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and S.H.I.E.L.D. regained the remains. It has been stolen and used for evil many times, by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a>, <a href=\"../../the-hand/65-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Hand</a>, and <a href=\"../../henry-gyrich/29-9711/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Henry Gyrich</a>. Each time, the robot has been defeated and rebuilt (by heroes like <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wasp</a> and <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>)-only to be stolen again. Red Ronin is currently possessed and used by the evil villain <a href=\"/the-fixer/4005-16830/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16830\">The Fixer</a>-it appears that the cycle is still going.</p><p>Of course, the most prolific technology created and used by S.H.I.E.L.D. is the Helicarrier. The Helicarrier is outfitted with weapons, security, and is constantly filled with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are extremely effective and good fighters. The Helicarrier is always being attacked by villains, and they are barely ever successful. Read more about the Helicarrier at the top of the page. A smaller version of the Helicarrier, the Behemoth, is often used by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents on missions, including by the Squad and by <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a>. The Behemoth is similar to the Helicarrier, only there is less weapons, technology, and it isn't as fast or powerful.</p><p>As for other technology, S.H.I.E.L.D. has access to an infinite amount of military-level tech. Tools, weapons, anything that's used, S.H.I.E.L.D. can get. Anything from pistols to nuclear weapons is easily attainable. Fighter jets are often used by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents when it is necessary for their mission.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</h3><p>In the Ultimate Marvel universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. was started and first led by <a href=\"../../general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\" rel=\"nofollow \">General Thunderbolt Ross</a>, who is a major enemy of the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hulk</a>. S.H.I.E.L.D. funded and sanctioned projects like <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-5018/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Weapon X</a>, which created <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>. A now-black <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> took control of the group and was very effective. He tried to recreate the Super Soldier program, making another <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. the project failed and the formula turned the lead scientist on the project, <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a>, into the Hulk. S.H.I.E.L.D. tried again with the Oz formula. It was responsible for the creation of <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"../../green-goblin/29-1484/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Green Goblin</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sandman</a>, and <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>.</p><p>Also, Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D. created the <a href=\"../../ultimates/65-40504/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ultimates</a>, as the government enlisted Fury to create a strike force of government-sponsored superheroes. The force was similar to the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> in the 616 universe, and answers to Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><h3>Marvel Zombiverse (Earth-2149)</h3><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. also appears in Marvel Zombies Universe. At first, some of the members are already infected by the virus when Sentry came to Earth infected. The first of the members infected were Colonel America, <a href=\"../../ms-marvel/29-21561/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=\"../../hawkeye/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hawkeye</a>, and <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Black Widow</a>. <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a> is part of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. After these infections, it starts to go on from there, with the infected heroes infecting other heroes and villains while eating people completely. <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Daredevil</a> becomes infected by <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> after saving <a href=\"../../nova/29-2105/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nova</a> and Nova is saved by the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> and goes to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. S.H.I.E.L.D. has called all uninfected heroes to meet together with Nick Fury and Nick Fury tells the uninfected heroes that they must make a defensive stand against the infected. The heroes agree to this, S.H.I.E.L.D. Avengers, and many more alike, and they go fight the zombies. However, this ends in tragedy and the uninfected become infected by the virus. The heroes were no match for the zombies and they all subdue to infection, becoming one of them. S.H.I.E.L.D. becomes no more and all of the members are killed or infected.</p><h3>Mutant X (Earth-1298)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-661527\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-661527\"><img alt=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099</figcaption></figure><p>In this reality, S.H.I.E.L.D. now stands for Save Humanity by Intervention in the Evolution of Life-form Deviants.

After much planning, expense, and hard work, the ship was built. However, as its launch neared, the federal government decided to cut funding for the flight. Reed determined that there was no choice but to launch the ship before the entire effort was scrapped and wasted.</p><p>Reed invited his girlfriend Susan Storm along for the trip, and her brother Johnny Storm insisted on accompanying to keep her safe. Wanting a pilot with both the ability and the courage to make the flight, Reed turned to his former college roommate and close friend Ben Grimm, a highly accomplished former test pilot for the United States Air Force. Everyone was ready for launch when Reed received a warning from the authorities, concerning the effects of the cosmic rays on human bodies so far out in space. Reed's request for launch was denied, and the mission aborted.</p><p>More desperate than ever to make the flight, Reed's crew waited until the guards changed that night, then snuck onto the ship and launched before any planes could be scrambled to intercept them and/or shoot them down. Successful in leaving the Earth's atmosphere, they were halfway along on their mission when they entered a sub-space storm and were bombarded by intense cosmic rays both before and stronger than they expected. This unexpectedly powerful cosmic ray storm had strange and disorienting effects on the crew, making them unable to continue the trip. They turned back, returned to Earth, and crash-landed in a small opening in a forested area.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.70032573289902\" data-width=\"614\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 614px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248591\"><img alt=\"The Birth of the Fantastic Four\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Birth of the Fantastic Four</figcaption></figure><p>Luckily, the team survived the crash, but were radically changed. Ben felt his body become heavy and found he'd turned into a monster. Reed tried to calm him down and restrain him when he realized that he'd reflexively stretched, wrapping his body around Ben like elastic. Johnny burst into flames while Sue panicked and turned invisible. Gathering their wits, they soon managed to calm themselves and agreed to use their new-found powers for the good of humanity and stay together as a team. Johnny dubbed himself the \"Human Torch,\" Sue took the name \"Invisible Girl\" (and later changed it to the \"Invisible Woman\"). Ben chose the name \"Thing,\" and Reed decided to call himself \"Mr. Fantastic.\" Thus, the Fantastic Four were born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Fantastic Four was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in Fantastic Four #1, November 1961. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four after seeing what a success DC Comics' Justice League was. While this is no doubt true, it has also been rumored for years that Stan actually patterned the FF team after DC's Sea Devils team and The Challengers of the unknown. Looking at the composition of both teams, there are a lot of similarities, so this rumor could well be correct.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1189434\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.93169877408056\" data-width=\"571\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 571px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1189434\"><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 571w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 571w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man</figcaption></figure><p>The first family super team of Marvel Comics, the <b>Fantastic Four</b> opened up the genre to a whole new way of telling the old story of family binds above all else. The Fantastic Four as a team made their public debut when a villain named Mole Man (A villain that lives underground) began attacking the surface. The Fantastic Four continued their illustrious careers as superheroes and unlike Spider-Man, they were well loved by the public and the media by appearing on television and more.</p><p>Reed Richards also created the “ unstable molecules” which are used for their costumes. This allows Reed’s costume to stretch as he does, Invisible Girl’s goes invisible when she does, and Human Torch’s doesn't burn up when he flames on. Reed would also discover The Negative Zone ( Stan Lee and Jack Kirby shared credit for the creation of the Negative Zone and unstable molecules). The Negative Zone is a parallel universe in which all matter is negatively charged. It also has a breathable atmosphere which allows Mr. Fantastic to lead his team in adventures in the Negative Zone. The Negative Zone is mostly uninhabited and Reed was eventually able to map out most of the area.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216479\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.119293078056\" data-width=\"679\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 679px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216479\"><img alt=\"FF 38 (1965) - Sue is bound next to the Q-bomb\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 679w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 571w\"><noscript><img alt=\"FF 38 (1965) - Sue is bound next to the Q-bomb\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 679w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\"></noscript></a><figcaption>FF 38 (1965) - Sue is bound next to the Q-bomb</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most important issues of the Silver Age was FF 38, \"Defeated by the Frightful Four\". This is the first issue where the FF are actually defeated by the end of the story. Medusa shows superb cunning by creating a trap for the Invisible Girl. She lures Sue to an East Side fashion house, on the pretext of showing her some wedding dresses. When Sue arrives, Medusa captures her easily with her deadly red hair and the Trapster makes certain the blonde girl cannot escape by shooting her with his paste gun. The Wizard flies himself, Sue and his two partners up into the air. The Frightful Four take an unconscious Invisible Girl to an isolated Pacific island and then go into an underground chamber. Wizard directs Trapster to place the girl down next to the detonation mechanism of a powerful nuclear Q-bomb! The Fantastic Four follow in an attempt to rescue Sue. However, after a brief battle, the Frightful Four escape, leaving the FF on the island. Fortunately Sue's partners find her just in time and Reed gets Sue to use her force field. The bomb explodes. While the FF survive, they have lost their powers. Daredevil then assists them in FF 39-40, as the FF try and avoid death at the hands of Doctor Doom. They do not regain their powers until late in issue 40.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174781\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174781\"><img alt=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married</figcaption></figure><p>Reed and Sue eventually married in 1965 and it became a celebrity event. The couple continued their newly married life in the public eye for years to come. Later Sue would become pregnant with a baby boy whom would be named Franklin Richards. Due to Sue being pregnant, she had to take a temporary leave on the team. To take Sue's place, the Fantastic Four decided to recruit the Human Torch’s girlfriend, Crystal. However due to the pollution on Earth, Crystal was forced to leave the Fantastic Four soon after. Sue eventually gave birth to Franklin on 1968 in Fantastic Four Annual #6, and returned as an active member on the Fantastic Four.

Feeling angry she was not treated as an equal, Sue left the Fantastic Four at the end of Fantastic Four 130 and the Inhuman named Medusa would fill in for Sue while she took a break. Though still separated from her husband, the Invisible Girl did briefly return for the Annihilus storyline in issues #140 and #141 and a shocking event occurred at the end of #141 which seemed to cement Reed and Sue's separation permanently. Franklin's eyes began to glow and Mr. Fantastic was worried that they were all in grave danger. He picked up a ray gun and fired at his young son, almost hitting his wife in the process by the way. His act succeeded in stopping Franklin's eyes from glowing, but seemed to put the toddler into a coma-like state. Sue blamed Reed for harming Franklin and she walked out for a second time. The Thing declared an end to the Fantastic Four. Reed and Sue finally reconciled at the end of FF #149, but only after Namor staged a fight with Mr. Fantastic. However, Sue did not return to active FF duty for several more issues after the reconciliation. Namor really deserves praise for what he did, as he knew that Sue loved Reed and he put the welfare of the woman he loved above his own feelings for her.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221330\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.449591280654\" data-width=\"367\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 367px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221330\"><img alt=\"Medusa - Replacing the Invisible Girl\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg 367w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Medusa - Replacing the Invisible Girl\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Medusa - Replacing the Invisible Girl</figcaption></figure><p>The separation between Sue and Reed lasted for 19 issues. This is really significant, as it means the separation lasted for one year and 7 months. This was a very harsh break-up that could easily have ended in Sue and Reed getting a divorce. The fans seemed to side with Mr. Fantastic in the break-up and against the Invisible Girl. The Fantastic Four Fan Page in issue #152 actually had a shocking letter which urged the writers to kill Sue off and the FF Bullpen implied that a few other fans had also urged them to kill Sue, though not as many as had called for Sue and Reed to divorce. The Fan Page editorial staff went on to say that the consensus was that they had to find a way to make Sue think again, implying that perhaps the gorgeous blonde had not been thinking straight when she left Reed and the team. Medusa did perform in a satisfactory manner in Sue's absence, though she did not demonstrate the awesome power that Crystal did, when Crystal replaced Sue a few years earlier, due to Sue's maternity leave with baby Franklin Richards.</p><p>During the 1970s the Fantastic Four had many artists and writers who would continue the Fantastic Four’s public career as superheroes. A roster change would come up when the Thing temporarily lost his powers. Reed decided to hire mercenary Power Man ( Luke Cage) to fill in for Ben.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216535\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4814814814815\" data-width=\"675\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 675px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216535\"><img alt=\"Baxter Building layout\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg 675w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg 648w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg 432w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Baxter Building layout\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg 675w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg 648w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216535-baxter_building.jpg 432w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Baxter Building layout</figcaption></figure><p>Reed eventually finished developing an exoskeleton that mimics his strength as the Thing, and Ben returns to the Fantastic Four as an active member.

When the team returned back to Earth, Nathaniel decided to revert Franklin back to his original age as a child.</p><h3>Onslaught, Heroes Reborn and Heroes Return</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-232407\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7575\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-232407\"><img alt=\"Heroes vs. Onslaught\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Heroes vs. Onslaught\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Heroes vs. Onslaught</figcaption></figure><p>The Fantastic Four would later battle the psychic being known as Onslaught. Onslaught was too powerful for the Fantastic Four and all the heroes of Earth, it became a losing battle. However, the heroes devised a plan to defeat Onslaught but at the cost of all non-mutant hero lives. The Fantastic Four and all the heroes decided to sacrifice themselves in order to destroy Onslaught and were seemingly killed in the process.</p><p>Since Reed had developed so many advanced technologies, the Government attempted to seize all his equipment, however Nathaniel traveled back to this reality and stored all of Reed’s equipment into the Negative Zone. However, with Franklin’s reality-altering powers he was able to store all the sacrificed heroes in a pocket universe and was able to bring them back to life on this reality’s Earth. The team would later return from the Heroes Reborn Earth, and have to cope with the fact that they had been considered dead for more than a year.</p><p>During this time the team resided in Pier 4, since Four Freedoms Plaza now belonged to a group of super villains, masquerading as heroes known as, The Thunderbolts. It was also around this time when the team came in contact with a teenage girl calling herself Valeria von Doom, who claimed to be the daughter of Susan and Doom in the future. Sue was apprehensive at first with the girls story but eventually she and the rest of the team came to accept Valeria as both ally and friend.</p><h3>Valeria Richards</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2610171\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5803195962994\" data-width=\"1189\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1189px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2610171\"><img alt=\"Doom delivers Valeria\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-width=\"404\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 1189w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 607w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 404w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Doom delivers Valeria\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 1189w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 607w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2610171-2137597_doom_and_valeria___fantastic_four_vol_3_54.jpg 404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-width=\"404\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Doom delivers Valeria</figcaption></figure><p>In a struggle against Abraxas, Valeria forfeited her life in order to help bring back Galactus to life. But she would not die. She is transformed into the form of a fetus and transferred into Sue's womb, making Valeria's story true except for one notable difference. She had been Reed's daughter all along. Sue was pregnant again but all would not go well for the Invisible Woman. Due to Sue's cosmic radiation exposure it became difficult to give birth. With Reed away solving a world crisis, Johnny turns to Dr. Doom and asks him to help his sister. Doom was successful in the delivery but forced Sue to allow Doom to name the child. Doom would name her Valeria Richards after a woman that he had once loved.</p><p>The Mark Waid era saw the Fantastic Four we see a lot of new concepts and amazing arcs come to light. His first stories on the book dealt with the Fantastic Four as Imaginauts and how they dealt with the fame that they always had their way. We also saw glimpses of Johnny as a much more responsible man, thanks to his sisters conjecture.</p><p>We also witness Doom's ruthlessness in trying cause harm to the Fantastic Four at any costs. He sold his loves life, Valeria (his first love) in an attempt to gain more of the magics that were always in his blood and which he denounced for a life of science. Seeing now that having both would help him in his end, he betrayed her to demons and was able to get the magical knowledge he yearned for.</p><p>To add to that, when Doom delivered baby Valeria, he cast a spell on her that would make her his magical familiar and he used the connection to carry out a devastating attack against the team. In the instant she uttered \"Doom\" demons kidnapped Franklin and Reed and Johnny tried desperately to save him before Johnny was burnt badly by demon fire. Sue and Ben hurry to Reed to tell him what's happened when they discovered Johnny wailing and notice his burnt flesh. They explain what happened and the team sets out to rescue Franklin and heal Valeria from this affliction Doom gave upon her.</p><p>They travel to Latveria where the team is ambushed by Doom. He takes Valeria and uses his magic in order to have the team suffer through painful versions of each others powers. He gives Johnny, Reed's stretching abilities, stretching him to his limits. He gives Sue a painful version of her brother's flame power. He has Ben fight off dozens of monsters. And finally he sticks Reed in a room full of magical information. But with the help of Doctor Strange, (or should I say his astral projection), Reed escapes and saves his family. Together they defeat Doom, and rescue Franklin and Valeria. Doom was vanquished and left in Hell by Reed, but not before Doom instilled a parting gift on him and scarred his face. This encounter would have lasting affects on the team and Reed.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the Civil War, the super-hero community was split in two, one in favor of the Super-Human registration act and the other against it. Reed sided with the Pro-Registration side along with Iron Man as team leader against Captain America's Anti-Registration team. A group of civilians attacked Johnny and seriously injured him because they blamed the super-heroes for the Stamford Incident. Susan and Thing reluctantly joined Reed's side all the while looking over a hospitalized Johnny, who was seemingly neglected by Reed. Reed, Sue and Ben joined the first battle against Captain America's Secret Avengers where a Cyborg Thor, made by Iron Man, Hank Pym and Reed, joined the battle and killed Goliath. After witnessing this, Sue shielded Cap's team from Thor's attack, giving them the time they needed to teleport away. Although Reed tried to explain himself, Sue refused to hear any of it. She decided to turn her back on Reed, and along with Johnny, who was released from the hospital, she joined the Secret Avengers and left a note for Reed explaining her actions and begging him to spend time with the children, who were neglected by Reed since the start of this struggle. However, Ben refused to participate in this war any longer, and although he did not agree with the Registration Act, he refused to fight the Government so he left for France. Reed remained with Iron Man and even helped built a prison in the Negative Zone meant for the rogue heroes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363219\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.31919296430419\" data-width=\"1933\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1933px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:31.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363219\"><img alt=\"Reed saves Sue in the Civil War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 1933w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Reed saves Sue in the Civil War\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 1933w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Reed saves Sue in the Civil War</figcaption></figure><p>In the final battle between the two sides, Taskmaster shot at Sue but Reed intervened and took the bullet instead, wounding him. This angers Sue and she smashes Taskmaster down with an invisible construct. Johnny was seen attempting to ambush Iron Man from behind but failed, During the fight, Ben returned and tried to save as many people as possible from being caught in the crossfire. When Captain America decided to surrender, the heroes had to face all the destruction their fight had caused. Sue and Johnny were granted amnesty and they try to reconstruct the streets where the battle took place. In an attempt to reconcile their relationship, Reed is able to convince Sue to come back to him and go on a second honeymoon. He takes Sue to one of the moons of Saturn to try and rekindle their love, as well as give her their first true honeymoon, since they never had one. During their absence, Storm and Black Panther filled in for them along side Ben and Johnny.</p><h3>New Fantastic Four</h3><p>The new team's first mission was to find the body of their friend Gravity which was taken by Epoch in the story in order to recover him as the Protector of the Universe. However, the Silver Surfer, who has returned to being a Herald of Galactus, was tracking down Epoch, in order to feed her to Galactus, seeing her as an energy source capable of fulfilling his master's hunger. The team traveled to space and confronted the Surfer who, after a brief battle with Black Panther, agreed to help them find their friend but Epoch will be fed to Galactus. Surfer then told Thing that he is a Herald again because he realized that Galactus' is hunger is not related in the story to good or evil.</p><p>However, the recovered Gravity and the Fantastic Four refused to allow Galactus consume Epoch. The Black Panther, using a device similar to the one used by Doctor Doom that takes away the Surfer's Cosmic Powers, fought and defeated the Surfer but they were still no match for Galactus himself. Gravity used all the powers given to him by Epoch to feed Galactus, who restored the Surfer's powers and spared Epoch.</p><h3>Second Honeymoon</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216464\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.84470246734398\" data-width=\"689\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 689px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216464\"><img alt=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 689w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 689w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again</figcaption></figure><p>In the stories, Reed takes Sue to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, as a means for them to have a honeymoon, since they never took one when they originally married. While there, Reed discovers a strange object and begins to examine it. Unfortunately he is unsure of it and he teleports back to Earth so other scientists can see and help him determine what it was. In order to do so, however, he left Sue alone on the ship in which they traveled to Titan, where she was ambushed by the Frightful Four. Sue fought them off for as long as she could, but she was defeated. The Wizard proved his superb intellect by creating a gun which was set to the frequency of Sue's force field. One shot of the gun and Sue fell to the ground, unconscious. The Wizard placed a power dampener on her, making her totally helpless. Sue was held prisoner on her own ship, all in the hopes that Sue, as well as everyone else, recognize the Wizard as Reed's superior. Sue refuses to acknowledge him as her husbands superior, and he attacks her, now that she's subdued. The slap that the Wizard gives Sue is even more brutal than the one Reed delivered to her in FF 281. So much for a second honeymoon, as Sue has become a hostage of the Frightful Four for the third time in Fantastic Four history, the other two being Silver Age FF 38 and FF: The World's Greatest Comic Magazine 9 of 12. Reed, along with Johnny, Ben, Storm, and Black Panther head for the ship to stop the Frightful Four and rescue Sue.</p><p>Sue is subjected to attacks by the Wizard but eventually Reed and the rest of the team manage to return to the ship. Once there, Storm found Sue and released her from the special machine that neutralized Sue's powers. As a means of revenge, Sue threatened the Wizard with creating a force field around his heart. The Wizard, intimidated by the more powerful Sue, subsequently faints and the Frightful Four are then rocketed out into space on a smaller vessel.</p><h3>Brand New Day</h3><p>Before the Civil War, Spider-Man's identity was shared among many super-heroes including the Fantastic Four. On one occasion they in-listed Peter's help in journeying with them to the Macroverse where they helped save a princess from a group of barbarians. During this whole encounter, Peter never wore his mask.</p><p>In present time, The Fantastic Four seek Peter's help again in journeying to the Macroverse, from where Reed received a distress signal. At first Spidey refuses to go but then accepts after Reed produces him a check to pay his bills. However, after One More Day, the Fantastic Four have also forget of Spidey's identity, making the Human Torch, who was once a very close friend to both Peter and Spider-Man, very skeptical. When they arrive at the Macroverse, they discover five statues of themselves, the inhabitants of the Macroverse idolize them for their previous adventure. Once the Johnny realizes that the unmasked Spider-Man's statue's face is unrecognizable, he recalls that he once knew more about Spider-Man and wants to know what he did that caused them to forget who he is. When Spidey refuses to answer and declares that he won't go down that road again and that no one will ever know his secret, an angered Human Torch burns off Spidey's mask but Susan uses her powers to protect Peter's face and lashes out at Johnny for betraying Spidey's trust. However, they are in a war-zone between two races, and the combined might of Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four was able to return the Macroverse to peace. When they were heading back to Earth, Reed asks Spidey about his secret identity and how he was able to have everyone forget it. Spidey tells him that it was the result of a special spell that prevents anyone from knowing Peter's identity unless Peter himself unmasks. Johnny urges Peter to unmask since they're all friends but Peter still refuses until Reed tells him that he has a \"psychic firewall\" that allowing them to know his identity and keep it to themselves. Peter agrees and unmasks and they renew their friendship.</p><h3>Planet Hulk &amp; World War Hulk</h3><p>The Hulk, who is now under the control of Banner, was sent to Las Vegas by the Fantastic Four to investigate a Hydra Gamma Bomb. However, things went horribly wrong and the bomb detonated in his face so Human Torch and the Thing are sent to bring back the Hulk before more people get hurt. But Bruce doesn't seem to be in control any more, as the Hulk now appears as a bald Grey Hulk. As Ben and Johnny fight this mindless Hulk, he seems to be recalling some of the tragic events in his life. Ben realizes that some-thing's wrong with him and that the explosion somehow messed up his mind. Ben told Johnny that he and the Hulk were both hit by something that made them monsters people need but don't want and that \"monsters understand monsters\". He attempts to reason with the Hulk despite Torch's protests. However, this doesn't work and Hulk recalls Betty's death and hallucinates that Thing is the Abomination (who killed Betty) and savagely attacks the Thing who doesn't fight back. Hulk hits Thing so hard, Ben is immobilized and tastes blood and before Hulk could finish Thing off, Human Torch goes nova but it didn't seem to have any effect on him until the Hulk told them not to worry about him and that he's fine.</p><p>The fight in Las Vegas caused a lot of destruction so, the Illuminati were debating on whether or not Hulk should remain on Earth. Reed, Iron Man, Black Bolt, and Doctor Strange were all for sending Hulk into outer space, so he wouldn't harm anyone ever again. However, their plan didn't work out as they planned, as the Hulk, now stronger than ever, returned to Earth and declared war on the Illuminati, including Reed. When the Hulk came for Reed, with the help of Susan and the New Fantastic Four, he projected a hologram of the Sentry in order to calm the Hulk down, but his plan backfired and the Hulk defeated the Fantastic Four and captured him. The Hulk had built a gladiatorial arena in New York and equipped Reed and Tony with obedience disks, forcing them to fight each other to the death. Reed defeated Tony but Hulk spared because he came for justice, not murder. During the final battle between Sentry and the Hulk, Stark used a satellite cannon to finally defeat the Hulk.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2220918\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4446640316206\" data-width=\"506\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2220918\"><img alt=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 506w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 443w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 506w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 443w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1</figcaption></figure><p>The Illuminati investigated the corpse of Elektra who turned out to be a Skrull when Black Bolt revealed himself to be a Skrull himself and attacked the other members only to be killed by Namor. The Illuminati then separated since anyone of them could be a Skrull. Reed and Hank Pym were examining the body of the Skrull in order to find out why the Skrulls are undetectable. When Reed discovered why, Hank revealed himself to be a Skrull and shot Reed with a special gun, destabilizing him.</p><p>He was taken to a Skrull armada in orbit where he was tortured by the Skrulls until being save by SWORD agent Abigail Brand. Using the information he discovered in the lab, Reed was able to develop a weapon that undoes the Skrulls shape-shifting abilities. Brand and Richards both traveled to the Savage Land where they used this weapon to identify the Skrulls during their battle with the New and Mighty Avengers.</p><p>Susan was on a speaking tour around the world when she was attacked in her hotel room by Skrull Reed who used a forcefield to knock her out and neutralize her. That same Skrull took the form of Susan in order to infiltrate the Baxter Building while Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria were there, and opened a portal to the Negative Zone causing half the building along with everyone in it, the Skrull Susan, Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria, to be sucked in. While in the Negative Zone, they were attacked by Bug-like monsters. While Ben protected the kids from the \"bugs\", Johnny and Sue made it back to Reed's lab where they debated on who she really was. He asked her what her favorite movie was to which she answered wrong. The Skrull revealed herself to be Lyja, Johnny's ex. They fight and Lyja is captured by a Negative Zone monster but Torch saves her and they kiss for old times' sake. Franklin and Valeria make their way back to the lab to get a machine their dad built for them for defensive purposes and they help Thing fight off the rest of the bugs. Franklin suggests that they should free the Tinkerer from his N-Zone prison in order to help them fix the Baxter Building. While on their way to the prison on the Fantasticar, Valeria falls off, only to be saved by Lyja, who reveals that she was sent to kill them all but because of her feelings for Johnny she sent them to the N-Zone instead. The Thing frees the Tinkerer, and after an agreement, he manages to return the building to normal. As they make their way back to a ruined New York, Lyja decides to stay behind.</p><p>Sue was revealed to be held captive on another Skrull ship along with other heroes and villains, who were freed and returned back to Earth when Iron Man destroyed the Skrull ship. After returning to Earth, she reunited with Reed and they both checked on their family before joining the final battle along side their fellow heroes against the Skrulls.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>When the Fantastic Four were attacked by HAMMER agents, Reed built a device called the Bridge which allowed him in the story to explore alternate dimensions. The team was sent to other continuities, leaving Franklin and Valeria under siege from Norman Osborn, HAMMER agents and Venom. Valeria was able to outsmart them and separate Osborn from his agents and led in a room where he was confronted by Franklin wearing a Spider-Man mask, calling him a villain. While Osborn is chasing the children holding a gun, the Fantastic Four make their way back to the Baxter Building where an enraged Invisible Woman scream at Osborn to stay away from her children. However, the insane Osborn challenges her to make him, which she does by knocking him down with a forcefield and preventing his remaining forces from reaching him. Reed tells Osborn to leave and never return but he replies by attempting to shoot Reed, only to be shot by Franklin. However, Franklin was holding a harmless toy gun, having Ben and Johnny thinking that Franklin's powers may have returned. Sue then told Reed to destroy the Bridge which he did but secretly he put it back together.</p><h3>Prime Elements; the end of a Family</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221100\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221100\"><img alt=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party</figcaption></figure><p>On Franklin's birthday, an older Franklin infiltrated the Baxter Building and used a forcefield to prevent the team from reaching him.

They were able to escape thanks to Doom’s hubris, and Sue was able to turn his armor invisible, showing his disfigurements to the world.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Four-Told</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8113821\" data-ratio=\"1.3804730749874\" data-width=\"1987\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1987px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.0%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8113821\"><img alt=\"The angry people of Spyre\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" data-width=\"463\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 1987w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 1390w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 695w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 463w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The angry people of Spyre\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 1987w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 1390w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 695w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8113821-rco020_1579831828.jpg 463w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" data-width=\"463\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The angry people of Spyre</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">After The Marvel-1, the ship the F4 used when they got their powers, was put on display in a museum, Reed got obsessed with the idea of going on the excursion he originally meant to go on, talking the rest of the team into joining.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">They landed on Spyre, where the people have been dreading a visit from the Fantastic Four for years. Reed’s first faster-than-light scan of their planet for viability was considered a warning of invasion. A scientist, The Overseer, mirrored the scan and not only witnessed the team try and fail to make it to his planet but also receive their powers. Believing them to be a threat, he harnessed the energy of the cosmic storm to make his own superhero team, The Unparalleled. After a brief confrontation, they are able to prove to The Overseer that they are not a threat.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Settling in was a culture shock. The Spiricans have a tradition of “soul-mates.” Similar to marriage, couples are outfitted with special arm bands that connect them. Reed and Sue got their own, having shown up to the planet as a dedicated couple, but Johnny got linked to Unparalleled member, Sky. Unfortunately, the Unparalleled also had Ben disposed of in the hidden world under the city. Every few users of the cosmic storm power would turn into a monster like The Thing and shunned by their society.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Suspicious of The Overseer, Reed investigated his ability to harness the cosmic storm. He had proof that Overseer weaponized the cosmic storm ahead of the F4’s attempted journey. The storm of their origin wasn’t a random phenomenon but a preemptive strike. Although that was enough to convince The Unparalleled and The Monster Mob from under the city that the F4 was not a threat, it was short-lived. Their confrontation with the Overseer destroyed a city landmark, which bonded the monsters and superhumans against the F4.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The F4 were allowed to leave peacefully with a reluctant Sky, who had faith in the soul-mate tradition and stood by Johnny.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Empyre</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113845-n%2527kalla_%2528earth-616%2529_and_jo-venn_%2528earth-616%2529_from_empyre_fantastic_four_vol_1_0_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8113845\" data-ratio=\"1.192\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.2%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113845-n%2527kalla_%2528earth-616%2529_and_jo-venn_%2528earth-616%2529_from_empyre_fantastic_four_vol_1_0_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8113845\"><img alt=\"N'Kalla and Jo-Venn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113845-n%2527kalla_%2528earth-616%2529_and_jo-venn_%2528earth-616%2529_from_empyre_fantastic_four_vol_1_0_001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113845-n%2527kalla_%2528earth-616%2529_and_jo-venn_%2528earth-616%2529_from_empyre_fantastic_four_vol_1_0_001.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"N'Kalla and Jo-Venn\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113845-n%2527kalla_%2528earth-616%2529_and_jo-venn_%2528earth-616%2529_from_empyre_fantastic_four_vol_1_0_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8113845-n%2527kalla_%2528earth-616%2529_and_jo-venn_%2528earth-616%2529_from_empyre_fantastic_four_vol_1_0_001.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>N'Kalla and Jo-Venn</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">On a road trip in space, the F4 ran out of gas and needed a tow to the nearest space station.

They had no answers to stop the out of control energy until Val showed up with her commandeered Fantasicar and the prototype teleporter she had been working on with Reed. When she combined the teleporter with the Zero Force, it reconfigured into The Forever Gate, a gateway to every point in space and time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Soon after the parents of the Future Foundation kids came calling. They wanted to know where their kids were, since the F4 left them in space to continue looking for remnants of Molecule Man. So, Reed used the gate to bring them back.

They communicated back to her that Franklin had used up all his cosmic energy creating planets and fighting the alien enforcer. Learning this, she made her presence known. Griever trapped Reed, Ben, Sue, and Dragon Man in worlds based on their nightmare, waiting for Silver Surfer to show up with the Ultimate Nullifier. However, they don’t end up needing it.

The weaponry reminds Reed of Watcher tech, so he leads his team to find Uatu for answers. They find Nick Fury instead, who had been investigating for the Watcher a group calling themselves The Reckoning. They were supplying upgraded tech to war-like alien races. Uatu knew about them and downloaded his knowledge to a data sphere before the Moon was destroyed. Reed helped himself to the sphere, downloading all The Watcher knowledge to his vulnerable human mind. He saw that The Reckoning was the first race The Watcher’s tried to help, which went so bad they took a vow only to watch from then on. Now, The Reckoning is back.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Reed used his new hyper intelligence to collaborate with the heroes in the field, inviting She-Hulk and Jack of Hearts to join them at his side. He determined that aiding the Shi’ar in defending the M’kraan crystals was their top priority, so, without Johnny, who believed he was needed elsewhere, or Sue, who was sent to keep an eye on the Watchers, they used the Forever Gate to get to Shi’ar space. Unfortunately, Ben is hurt badly enough in a fight with The Reckoning to distract the whole team away from the M’kraan, which is taken. Jen believed they went to the one planet the Watchers’ can’t see: Obscura Minor, which can’t be seen due to Jen’s cosmic judicial ruling. Reed tapped into the Watcher’s knowledge of “traveling at night” to move them there.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once there, they fell into traps set up by The Reckoning, so The Reckoning could steal the Forever Gate. Reed was able to reconstruct one using his Watcher intelligence and powering it with Jack of Hearts, who was abandoned in their prison. They used the gate to reach the Watcher’s planet to stop The Reckoning from getting to The Apex of the Watchers’ powers. They are reunited with their other family members where they debate a fatal solution: Reed using the Ultimate Nullifier on Wrath, leader of The Reckoning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thankfully, Reed was not killed by the Ultimate Nullifier, as it was designed to be used by a Watcher, which he had been turning into. Instead, it burned out the Watcher transformation. Uatu, who had absorbed all of the Watcher knowledge and power for himself, used the power to set everything right. He returned the heroes to their homes, including Jack of Heart, restored Galactus but with a hunger for knowledge, reassembled Earth’s Moon, and pulled the barrier down on the edge of space, increasing the universe by 90%.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Fantastic Four Suits</h2><p>Reed had invented specialized suits made of unstable molecules which could adapt to him and his teammates' powers. For him, his suit allows him to stretch to great lengths without tearing it. The costume also makes them harmless against electrical attacks. They are also computers. In them, they have something equivalent to a computer. It forms a network, keeping the team up to date. It also displays data for them and touchpad controls are available on their gauntlets. The costume is like a GPS, providing their location. It has a scanner which can scan things in their environment, being able to scan things like how many people are in the room next to them.</p><h3>Members</h3><ul><li>Spider-Man- once tried to \"apply\" to the team but reconsidered when he wasn't gonna get paid.</li><li>Hulk -in the Grey Hulk and the Professor personality in different occasions.</li><li>Wolverine</li><li>Ghost Rider -Danny Ketch version.</li></ul><p>When a female Skrull captured the original team, she impersonated the Invisible Woman to recruit a new team to avenge the \"death\" of the original and to steal a weapon from the Mole Man.</p><p>The team reassembled again by Doctor Strange to arrest the Human Torch for his actions that destroyed a quarter of a city.</p><h2>Ultimate Universe</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486710\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486710\"><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610</figcaption></figure><p><b>Earth-1610</b></p><p>The Fantastic Four of the Ultimate universe is composed younger versions of the original four, Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and Thing.

Sue could generate invisible force fields and arrange light making her invisible. Johnny could generate fire and fly. Ben turned into a rock brute with super strength. When Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny came together once again faced an old Baxter teacher now going as the Mole Man. The four face his mole men and won.</p><p>Later they decided to find Victor. They found him in Latveria where he was manipulating the locals with dragon tattoos. He now had metal instead of skin. He went against the four but he could not be arrested in Latveria. When going back Reed decided to go to the N-Zone to revert the process on himself and Ben.</p><p>The four went up in space and teleported into the N-Zone where they made first contact with Ultimate Annihilus. While on the N-Zone, N-ihil pretended to be the Four's friend and explained how realities are stacked on the universe. That's when they became enemies. They returned home along with some sort of dinosaur leaving Annihilus in the N-Zone. Then they faced an old think tank jealous Brainiac going by the name The Thinker. She took over the Baxter Building and started going up against Reed. Brain against brain. The better genius won and the Thinker, Rhona Burchill, escaped. Johnny went to school with Peter Parker (AKA Spider-man). Johnny fell for a girl named Liz Allen. MJ, Peter, Kong, Liz and Johnny went to the beach together. There he was seen using his powers. Liz being mutant-phobic stopped talking to him so Peter as Spidey went and cheered him up. Reed made contact with himself and the rest of the FF from another universe making them become the Ultimate Frightful Four.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192175\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5690476190476\" data-width=\"420\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 420px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192175\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Fantastic Four-Reed Richards of Earth 1610 Meets The Reed Richards of Earth 616\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" data-width=\"407\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg 420w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg 407w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Fantastic Four-Reed Richards of Earth 1610 Meets The Reed Richards of Earth 616\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg 420w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192175-21_1.jpg 407w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" data-width=\"407\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Fantastic Four-Reed Richards of Earth 1610 Meets The Reed Richards of Earth 616</figcaption></figure><p>Reed trying to cure Ben decided to change time. As a result Skrulls went to earth and gave them pills to give them superpowers. In the end they were betrayed by them all and they all died for the exception for Ben Grimm who didn't take the pill. He fought the Super-Skrull that used a suit to copy their powers. With no powers to be able to copy Ben took over and went back in time to stop the stopping of the accident. Again they faced the Frightful Four zombies and Doom went down along with them trying to be a hero. Spider-Man had a clone crisis and went to the FF for help. One of the clones who thought was Peter's father asked Sue to be his friend before dying. Reed cured MJ from a monster transformation she was having because of the clones. Then they gave the Scorpion clone to SHIELD. Ga Lak Tus was going to destroy the world and the FF did their part in stopping him. Teaming up with Ultimate Captain Marvel and the Ultimates they got information from the Kree.</p><p>Reed created a machine that would damage Ga Lak Tus with the help of the Ultimate Vision. The Fantastic Four then went up against Gallowglass and Ronan. They also faced their father Thanos and got out of the problem with the help of Seed. The Thinker came back stealing Cerebro's hard drive and making the X-Men believe that it was the FF's fault. In the end they teamed up to defeat her. Then they faced Diablo a guy who created a teleportation from past to present and relied on magic.</p><p>After the Fantastic Four first encountered Thanos in his home dimension, Thanos implanted the idea for the Cosmic Cube in Reed Richard's mind. Legend told that Thanos had discovered the original Cosmic Cube after it feel from the sky above his planet. With it he would attempt to control all existence. Thanos' defeat was narrow, and the costs were great. While Reed believed that he was creating the cosmic cube out of his own accord, Thanos was controlling Reed in order to re-create the powerful weapon that he once lost. As Reed continued to analyze the possibilities contained within the energy lattice, he found the draw of creating a cube irresistible. Reed's first attempt to harness the energy required for fueling the cube would result in the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the real Silver Surfer as well as the inter-dimensional being that they would com to know as the Psycho-Man.</p><p>Sue then had to face Red Ghost. After the Red Ghost's defeat Reed would continue to work on developing the Cube. She went by herself to what she thought was a conference but was caught with the woman who became the Ultimate Red Ghost. With the help of the Ultimate Crimson Dynamo the rest of the FF saved Sue. Because of the actions of Reed while building the cube their relationship was broken off. When he finished the cube it automatically protected New York from an attack from Seed. Thanos' forces would spring foreword, removing a block of New York City containing the Four to take back to his home dimension. Thanos battled Reed in order to take the cube by force. While the Cube was a powerful weapon, Reed's inexperience wielding it made him susceptible to Thanos' power, and Reed was seemingly destroyed before Thanos acquired the cube. Using the power of the cube, Thanos came into our reality and took over the minds and wills of Earth's superheroes including the Ultimates, the X-Men, the remaining members of the Fantastic Four, and all solo heroes. These heroes in turn helped Thanos capture any remaining rebels. Thanos was disturbed because he could tell that he somehow didn't have full access to the Cube's vast powers as he once did.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504374\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.42\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504374\"><img alt=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 800w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 676w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 800w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 676w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>War over the Cosmic Cube</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Ben Grimm had located Thanos' estranged daughter Atrea who helped him realize that Reed was not actually dead. During his battle with Thanos Reed used the power of the Cosmic Cube to create a charred likeness of himself, while turning his actual form into an energy being. This move allowed him to escape Thanos' full power by being perceived as dead. Atrea felt Reed was still alive but trapped, and freed his essence.</p><p>Convincing Atrea to rebel against her father, the three traveled back to their home dimension to battle Thanos. In the middle of the warped landscape of New York they found his citadel. With Atrea and Ben acting as a diversion Reed was able to get to Thanos to battle for control of the Cosmic Cube. While in partial control of the Cosmic Cube, Reed knew he was no match for Thanos' power.</p><p>The small portion of the Cube's power which Thanos previously was denied access to was Reed's work. Reed unlocked this sequestered power within the Cube, giving Thanos full access to the Cube's infinite resources. With full access to the Cosmic Cube restored, Thanos' physical form quickly deteriorated as he died. Thanos' infatuation with death had created a subconscious drive within himself, and it was that desire for the fullness of death that destroyed Thanos.</p><p>This left Reed the question of what to do with the Cube. It's vast powers had proven to dangerous for anyone, even himself, to wield. In order to deal with the Cube Reed opened up a very small rift in space and time and dropped the cube through. The cube plummeted through the rift and landed on Thanos' home planet many years earlier. The cube found its way to the sand in front of Thanos' very feet. The resulting paradox was that the original Cosmic Cube, the cube that Thanos had tricked Reed into building for him, was actually the Cosmic Cube that Reed had designed and built.</p><p>After the Cosmic Cube event Sue went up with a new mystery. An giant egg was found along with the ex-Think Tank people now living underground. The the Ultimate Salem's Seven appeared into the picture trying to stop a flaming building and getting all the glory.</p><p><strong>March on Ultimatum</strong></p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of Captain America, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Rogue and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of Ultimatum so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards.</p><p>The then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a Sentinel from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverines and Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually Scott. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over a s Captain America after Steve Rogers aged 100 years, then he died. In the future Iceman was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be Johnny he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, Namor and Firestar.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops´s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. Ben and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met Nihil again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue´s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother´s death. Everyone let the future hero´s free from a prison in the N-Zone Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that future would not happen.</p><h3>Ultimatum</h3><p>It's Tuesday 4:12 PM. Reed Richards is about to propose to Sue. Ben Grim is working out with H.E.R.B.I.E watching over. Johnny Storm and his father are having a heated argument on Johnny's intelligence.</p><p>It's Tuesday 4:13 PM. New York is underwater.</p><p>At the Baxter Building, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl reach the roof top. A whale enters the room with the Thing, Johnny and Franklin Storm are underwater. At their rooftop of the Baxter, Sue uses all her power to keep the water away from New York and then she collapses. The Thing arrives and Reed leaves Sue with him.</p><p>At 4:21 PM, Reed is already on an FF submarine and meets with Namor. Reed accuses him of the event while Namor excuses himself saying it was not him.</p><p>It's 12:31 AM in Latveria and all except Dr. Doom are frozen solid.</p><p>Then, telepathically Xavier tells all superheroes, that he knows who is responsible for this events, and that all of them have to unite against this threat, to stop Magneto.</p><p>Back in the Baxter, Ben takes over and is now alone. The Baxter Building is turning invisible and Sue isn't stable. No scientist knows how to help her, and the one scientist who might have a chance of saving her is dead, Franklin Storm is dead.</p><p>The Thing has gone out of resources and Sue´s mother then arrives. She suggest that the person who could help would be Dr. Molveick a.k.a. The Mole Man. With the help of the students from Baxter B help Ben find Mole Man and save him from fire mole men. As a result he helps the Thing figures out that the way to help Sue is to internally help her. Using Pym particles the Thing and the Mole man are going to go inside the Invisible Girl.</p><p>The Thing and the Mole Man Successfully rescue Sue from herself by going inside. Inside they fix the problem and then after that Sue recovers completely. During the journey inside Sue Ben and Dr. Molevick found some strange antibodies that attacked them. Sue explained that these weren't antibodies, they were actually some form of robotic organisms implanted inside her by Reed without any of the Fantastic Four's knowledge. Because of this Sue realized that with he GPS system imbedded in them she could locate Johnny. So she gets to work. This storyline is most reminiscent of the 1966 Sci-Fi classic entitled Fantastic Voyage. That film shrunk a submarine and sent of team inside of an important diplomat to save his life.</p><p>Sue realizes that they need a huge antenna to locate Reed and Johnny around the world, so Sue's mother explains how advanced Atlantean technology could become useful here. Sue, Dr. Molevick, Mrs. Richards and Ben head into deep waters to get this technology. On their dive they discover some other Atlantean fugitives that were locked up. After being captured, since they couldn't surpass the power of these people, Sue's mother makes a deal that gets them out of the mess. They leave from Atlantis and create the necessary equipment to locate the nanobots implanted in Johnny and Reed. A mapping system appears showing the location of the rest of the team but it shows they aren't necessarily on earth. On a different earth Reed is with Dr. Doom and Princess Zarda while Johnny is in a dimension where Dormammu, a demon lord, rules.</p><p>Hulk and Spider-Man see Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum blowing up. Magical beings start bursting out of control and Hulk and Spidey try and stop it. Dormammu, powered by the Human Torch, appears and kills everything in his path, apparently including Spider-Man.</p><p>Doctor Strange tries fighting off this monster but fails and get's killed in the process.</p><p>Now that Sue and Ben have located Johnny they go in to get him back. The Invisible Woman uses a forcefield over Dormammu's head cutting the oxygen from the monster and Johnny gives it all it's got to cut his breathing off. The effect brings him to turn back into a little man re-unites the Storms and 3/4 of the FF.</p><p>Reed finally comes back with Nick Fury and he along Doctor Doom and Princess Zardra take the fight to Magneto. The X-Men take the battle to Magneto and what's left of his brotherhood. Nick Fury, with the help of Jean, shows Magneto how mutants are just a man-made accident. After this Cyclops kills Magneto.</p><h3>Post-Ultimatum</h3><p>After the events of Ultimatum, Sue and Reed break up and the Fantastic Four are officially disbanded. Reed goes back to his parent's house, Sue takes over the Baxter Building for herself, burying herself in work, Ben joins the military and Johnny starts to travel.</p><p>After some time Johnny got tired of traveling around so instead of going to the Baxter he arrived on Peter Parker's doorstep. After talking to his sister he decides to live with the Parkers, Iceman and Gwen Stacy all while going to high school.</p><h3>Ultimate Enemy</h3><p>Reed Richards, now ex-leader of the world famous Fantastic Four, now lives with his parents and his father is not happy about that especially since he has no job to contribute to the family. After being brutally woken up by his father, Reed's computer detects an energy flux, and then somebody knocks at the door, even though Reed warns his father not to open the door, he opens it, and a purple, cloud-like explosion happens inside the Richard's home.</p><p>Sue uses her invisible powers to hide herself from the rest of the world while taking a walk in the city. She feels better when not having to be a world spectacle to the rest of the world. Once back in the Baxter she wonders all alone the place only to find Ben Grim interrupts her loneliness. After a brief catching up between the two, Sue examines Ben's recent shedding of rocks and Ben drops a bomb on her by telling her that he loves her. Now that her relationship with Reed is over he took the opportunity to tell her that. One of the Thing's rocks falls and leaves Sue by saying: \"something to remember me by\". Then a huge, purple, cloud/octopus-like creatures overtakes the Baxter building and Ben even when trying to stop it he is thrown to a street.</p><h2>Other Variants</h2><h3>Earth-2149</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486717\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5036363636364\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486717\"><img alt=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Zombie Four of Earth-2149</figcaption></figure><p>*In the Zombie Universe the Fantastic Four as most other heroes are transformed into zombies.

Unknown to the director, crew and actors of the film, this movie was never intended to be released. The film starts with Reed and Victor Von Doom in college. An experiment goes goes wrong and Victor is allegedly killed. Reed's friend introduces him to her children Sue (a teenager) and Johnny (a preteen). Reed grieves for his friend but finishes school and years starts a space expedition (one that is to be piloted by his roommate Ben Grim) and they decide to bring, a now older, Sue and Johnny along (for shits and giggles).</p><p>Little do they know that Victor Von Doom did not die the day of that horrible experiment, and to that day had been planning his revenge on the man he assumes is responsible for his experiment not working (none other than Reed Richards of course). He sabotages their ship so it flies right on course with some cosmic rays (an energy source that has unknown strength) the ship seems to be destroyed in space. Doom laughs a terrible laugh and marvels in his years of planning coming to fruition.</p><p>The group survives the cosmic ray exposure and they crash land back on earth even though their ship blew up and it shouldn't be possible. Once they find they are all alive, they also discover they all have amazing powers. Reed Richards is elastic, Sue can hide from sight, Johnny is the Human Torch, and Ben has become the Thing, with a large gravel-like exoskeleton and super strength.</p><p>All you need to know is that Doom finds out the Fantastic Four are still alive and lures them to his lair.

The film was directed by Tim Story and released by 20th Century Fox, and though it was the first Fantastic Four film to be released it was the second to be filmed. This film told of the forming of the Fantastic Four and how they got their abilities. It was also a tale of their change in mindset when they slowly began to accept that it was their duty to be heroes, they were not destined to be normal, even Ben came to terms with this. The film also depicted the origins of the team's nemesis Dr. Doom and showed the characters developing their powers, pushing them to their limits and learning how they work. In the end, when working as a team they find themselves able to defeat Dr. Doom, his \"dead\" body is then shipped off to Latveria.</p><p>Among the deleted scenes included on the December 2005 DVD release:</p><ul><li>Three slightly modified scenes concerning the attack on Doctor Doom - one in which Reed uses his body as a funnel to direct a stream of water at Doom, one in which he doesn't, and one in which Doctor Doom's line \"Is that the best you can do, a little heat?\" is cut short, having the \"..a little heat?\" portion removed.</li></ul><ul><li>Two versions of a scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. The original features the pair in the planetarium, where they communicate their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. This ends in a kiss. The second version, included in the DVD release as a bonus feature, features the two outside, looking toward the Statue Of Liberty. Similar lines are used, but it ends with Alba's Susan turning invisible before Gruffudd's Reed can kiss her. A joke was used during the line \"a stronger man\": Instead of Reed giving himself a square jaw (as he does in the theatrical release), he makes his skin look like the X-Men's Wolverine. Actor Gruffudd breaks the fourth wall and looks directly at the camera as he does this.</li></ul><ul><li>There is also a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building where we see on one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be H.E.R.B.I.E. from the 1970s Fantastic Four cartoon.</li></ul><p>The novelization of the film contained a number of scenes not in the final cut, including a small number of scenes that developed the character of Alicia Masters.</p><h4><strong>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/869109-fanfour2_newposter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869109\" data-ratio=\"1.4375\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.8%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/869109-fanfour2_newposter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869109\"><img alt=\"Rise of the Silver Surfer\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/869109-fanfour2_newposter.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/869109-fanfour2_newposter.jpg 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rise of the Silver Surfer\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/869109-fanfour2_newposter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/869109-fanfour2_newposter.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rise of the Silver Surfer</figcaption></figure><p>A sequel to the Fantastic Four film of 2005, this film was also directed by Tim Story.

Hearing of the Hulk’s rampage, <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Rick Jones</a> sent a radio message to <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> informing them of the problem, seeking to enlist their aid in stopping the Hulk. In a twist of fate, <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> diverted the message to Thor, whom he hoped would then battle the Hulk. Unbeknownst to Loki, and unintended, too, the message was also picked up by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant-Man</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">The Wasp</a>. These heroes, as well as Thor, all responded to the call and came together to stop the menace of The Hulk. Upon engaging the Hulk, they soon discovered Loki’s trickery and teamed up with Hulk to defeat the God of Mischief. Ant-Man mentioned to the other heroes that the five of them worked well together and suggested that they should combine to form a team to fight against threats that no lone hero could deal with. The Wasp proposes the name “Avengers” and thus <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth’s</a> Mightiest Heroes were formed. The original members are known as the \"founding members\" based on an Avengers Charter, to manage the good name of the team. As a result, their wishes regarding the direction of the team are given additional weight and deference.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Avengers were created by legendary comic creators <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> and made their first appearance in <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\">The Avengers</a> #1 (Sep. 1963) in the story “The Coming of the Avengers”.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Founding Members</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant-Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a></li><li><a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Iron Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a></li><li><a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a></li><li>Captain America (Inducted as Founding Member after Hulk left)</li></ul><p>The founding members of Avengers, apart from Hulk, were already recognized and established as superheroes before the team formed. The public opinion of the Hulk at this time was very uncertain. Some thought he was a misunderstood creature who just wanted to be left alone. However mainly because of the efforts of <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">General “Thunderbolt” Ross</a>, the majority of public viewed The Hulk as a rampaging monster. Almost from the beginning the Avengers team roster has changed steadily, with the Hulk departing during their second adventure and <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> joining soon after. The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the team although one theme has been constant - The Avengers fight the foes that no single superhero could defeat - hence their famous cry of \"Avengers Assemble!\"</p><p>The Avengers have always accepted a diverse range of members, regardless of their backgrounds, as long as they are ready to fight the good fight. To that end, the team has featured humans, <a href=\"/robots/4015-56059/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56059\">robots</a>, <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutants</a>, Gods, <a href=\"/aliens/4015-46567/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\">aliens</a>, supernatural beings and even former villains. Despite the diverse nature of the team, which often results in squabbling, the Avengers have always managed to unite into a stable unit to combat the deadliest threats in the universe.</p><p>Leadership of the group has varied over the years but has almost always fallen back to the hands of Captain America. Founding members Hank Pym, Iron Man, Thor and Wasp have also served extensively as leaders to different incarnations of the group. Other members have also taken up the role of leadership, to varying degrees of success, but the most prominent ones would be Hawkeye, Monica Rambeau, Ms. Marvel, Scarlet Witch, U.S.Agent and Vision.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>During their first team meeting there was immediate tension between the Avengers as Thor and Hulk exchanged words. Soon enough a body snatching <a href=\"/space-phantom/4005-7243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7243\">Space Phantom</a> arrived with plans to destroy the Avengers to clear the path for an alien invasion. The Space Phantom switched bodies with each Avenger and planted seeds of distrust and hatred amongst them. It was clear that the other Avengers never truly trusted the Hulk and in fact admitted to each other they had him join their ranks to keep an eye on him. The Space Phantom managed to have the Hulk realize this distrust in the others and he left the team.</p><p>Soon afterwards The Hulk was befriended by <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> the Sub-Mariner and the two <a href=\"/antiheroes/4015-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55830\">antiheroes</a> formed an uneasy alliance to battle their common foe - humans. The Avengers, who were searching for the Hulk to prevent him from harming others, were tipped off by the Teen Brigade of his location. A confrontation took place between the Avengers, Namor and Hulk. But in the middle of the battle Hulk changed to Bruce Banner and left Namor to fight the Avengers alone. Clearly outgunned, Namor escaped.</p><h3>Captain America Joins The Avengers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1979485\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png\" data-ratio=\"1.3913043478261\" data-width=\"575\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 575px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1979485\"><img alt=\"Captain America Lives Again\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png 575w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></a><figcaption>Captain America Lives Again</figcaption></figure><p>After their previous battle Namor vows revenge on The Avengers. While swimming the seas the Sub-Mariner comes across an Eskimo tribe worshipping a figure encased in ice. Filled with wrath at the air breathers, the Prince of <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> hurls the block of ice into the ocean. The ice thaws as it heads towards warmer waters and the body inside is eventually discovered by The Avengers who are in a submarine searching for Namor. The heroes bring the floating body on board and realise it is Captain America, who has been in suspended animation since the Second World War. Thus the Living Legend of World War II is reborn! Initially Cap attacks The Avengers mistaking them as threats but the issue is quickly settled and The Avengers take Captain America back to <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> where he helps them defeat Namor and the alien <a href=\"/starhammer/4005-50246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50246\">Vuk</a>. After their first battle together, Earth’s Mightiest Heroes offer membership to Captain America who gladly accepts. Cap would go on to become an embodiment of The Avengers and despite his later joining, given status as founding member.</p><p>The team's early adventures saw them battle <a href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\">Mole Man</a>, <a href=\"/red-ghost/4005-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2473\">Red Ghost</a>, <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang the Conqueror</a>, <a href=\"/count-nefaria/4005-3229/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3229\">Count Nefaria</a> and cross paths with their former ally the Hulk multiple times.</p><h3>Masters of Evil</h3><p><a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a> finds out that Captain America is alive and has joined the ranks of the Avengers.

When the Avengers defeat the villains, Baron Zemo is joined by the Asgardian gods in exile the <a href=\"/executioner/4005-3517/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3517\">Executioner</a> and <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a> and together with them free both the Black Knight and Melter to rejoin their ranks.</p><p>Their second attempt at defeating the Avengers goes no better, with the Enchantress seducing Thor and convincing him his fellow Avengers aren't what they seem in a bid to get him to defeat them and return to her arms. Unfortunately for the love-lorn Enchantress, Thor manages to shake off her influence and the Masters retreat to Zemo's base in the Amazon.</p><p>The Enchantress returns to New York to find a perfect candidate to for Zemo's Ion-powered machine. She found one in Simon Williams who was facing charges for embezzlement and was bitter at the man responsible for this: Tony Stark. Zemo transferred Simon into a living Ion-powered <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a> and sent him to infiltrate the Avengers. Having gained the Avengers trust and being welcomed onto the team, Wonder Man betrays them to Zemo. However, Wonder Man begins to feel guilty for his betrayal and decides to turn the tables on Zemo and his allies, but ultimately wound up apparently dying in the Avengers arms due to his sacrifice.</p><p>After a disastrous skirmish with the Avengers due to Immortus, Baron Zemo kidnaps <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Rick Jones</a> and Captain America goes to South America to save him. Meanwhile back at the home-front the rest of the Avengers again confront the Masters of Evil and again defeat and subdue Black Knight and Melter, as Enchantress and Executioner escape. Elsewhere, Captain America finally confronts <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Zemo</a> in what would be their final confrontation, as during battle, an avalanche Zemo caused crushes the Nazi and kills him.</p><h3>Second Genesis</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2021136\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5046296296296\" data-width=\"432\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 432px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2021136\"><img alt=\"Second Generation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 432w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Second Generation\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 432w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Second Generation</figcaption></figure><p>After the Wasp was almost killed in action and with the threat of the Masters of Evil halted, Giant Man and Wasp opted to retire from the Avengers. Thor, who was busy in Asgard, and Iron Man also withdrew from the team to instead focus on their personal lives. Captain America and Rick Jones remained behind as the team looked for replacement members. After inducting the adventurer Hawkeye who sought membership, the team tried to recruit the Sub-Mariner to no avail. After placing a classified ad seeking replacement Avengers, the former villains Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch replied and were welcomed onto the team. The new Avengers announced themselves to the public as Iron Man wished them luck.</p><p>The team were quick to recognize they lacked strength in their roster and wished to find another member. They first attempted to track down the Hulk and offer him a chance to rejoin the team but the plan ultimately failed. The team then inducted the mercenary known as Swordsman only for him to be sharply ejected due to the rest of the team no trusting him. The team halted their quest to battle against a variety of villains such as <a href=\"/atlas/4005-3277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3277\">Power Man</a>, Kang and Doctor Doom.</p><p>The quest for a strong member of the team came to it's end when the Atlantean <a href=\"/attuma/4005-15779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15779\">Attuma</a> attacked the surface world resulting in both Giant Man, who had re-established himself as Golaith, and Wasp returned to the team they helped found.

After helping the team against them, Hawkeye's girlfriend the <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> became a staunch ally and part-time Avenger incidentally was absent when the Avengers announced her as a full-time member. She continued to aid the team alongside her boyfriend.</p><p>The Enchantress sought revenge on the Avengers and duped the <a href=\"/olympian-gods/4060-44825/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44825\">Olympian God</a> <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> into attacking the team.

Having felt his power first hand and knowing his ties to the Asgardian Thunder God, Thor, the Avengers invited Hercules stay with them and over time he eventually became a full-fledged member of the team during his stay on Earth.</p><p>Rick Jones also returned and, now outfitted in the costume of Captain America's former sidekick Bucky, became a more active part of the team - often accompanying Captain America as his sidekick. Despite finally achieving some degree of acceptance as both a part of the team and Captain America's sidekick, Rick Jones was still overlooked or treat like a peripheral part of the unit.</p><p>The team continued on with their larger roster and battled the likes of <a href=\"/diablo/4005-10242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10242\">Diablo</a>, <a href=\"/dragon-man/4005-6823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6823\">Dragon Man</a>, <a href=\"/sons-of-the-serpent/4060-24273/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24273\">the Sons of the Serpent</a>, Sub-Mariner, <a href=\"/super-adaptoid/4005-10861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10861\">Super-Adaptoid</a> and the Russian superhero, and ex-husband of Black Widow, <a href=\"/red-guardian-shostakov/4005-7581/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7581\">Red Guardian</a>. At the same time, the Avengers looked for a way to cure their team-mate Goliath, whom had become stuck at giant-size.</p><h3>Depleting Numbers</h3><p>The Mandarin organized a new Masters of Evil group in a gambit to destroy the Avengers and his arch-nemesis Iron Man once and for all. The former Masters of Evil members Enchantress and Executioner were joined by <a href=\"/living-laser/4005-9904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9904\">Living Laser</a>, Power Man and Swordsman and sent to defeat the Avengers. Despite having their largest roster yet, the Avengers were briefly rejoined by both Iron Man and Thor to battle against the Mandarin's team of villains. Iron Man and Thor both left the group again after Mandarin and his cronies were defeated.</p><p>The tides quickly changed for the Avengers as the team began to fall apart. After the death of her ex-husband, the Black Widow left both Hawkeye and the Avengers and Captain America opted out of the team to establish a life of his own apart from the team. Rick Jones followed Captain America and eventually resigned altogether after he was beaten by the Red Skull disguised as Cap. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were next to leave after <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> (who unbeknownst to anyone involved, was their biological father) captured them both and tried to convince them to join his new Brotherhood of Mutants. In the skirmish that followed, Scarlet Witch was injured which led to both her and Quicksilver withdrawing from the team.

The mixture of different chemicals triggers a new persona, and Hank now calls himself Yellowjacket. This persona is more confident and free willed, a total opposite to his current personality. After thwarting and bashing some thugs, Hank enters the <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">Avengers Mansion</a> and wants to join their ranks. He makes claims that his Yellowjacket persona killed his Goliath persona. The Avengers didn’t take the news likely, so Hank grabs the Wasp and escapes to his miniature base outside the mansion. Hank then kisses the Wasp, and from that point-on the Wasp knows it is actually Hank.</p><p>The two decide to get married, and tons of superheroes make their way to the wedding of Yellowjacket and the Wasp.

Throwing aside his bow and arrows, Hawkeye decides to use Hank Pym's old Goliath chemicals and equipment and adopts the Goliath guise himself and frees the Black Widow.</p><h3>Let the Game Begin</h3><p>The <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\">Grandmaster</a> and <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang</a> plays a game of chess for the life of Kang's dead love, <a href=\"/ravonna/4005-7222/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7222\">Ravonna</a>.

The Sentinels plan to use a massive solar flare to sterilize all of the humans on Earth, which they believe will prevent the birth of future mutants. The Avengers manage to defeat the Sentinels, but Quicksilver (who had earlier broken away from the group and traveled to Australia without the others) is seriously injured, and ends up being left behind since the other Avengers are unaware of his presence. He nearly dies, but is rescued by <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>, who brings him to the hidden kingdom of<a href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\"> Attilan</a> to recover.</p><p>Not long after this, <a href=\"/mantis/4005-3324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3324\">Mantis</a> and <a href=\"/swordsman/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\">Swordsman</a> also join the team.

Kang believes that by forcing the Madonna to marry him, he will have control over the child once it is born.</p><p>The Celestial Madonna is eventually revealed to be Mantis, and Swordsman ends up being killed by Kang while trying to protect her. The Vision and Scarlet Witch end up marrying one another after this, while Mantis departs for space.</p><h3>The Serpent Crown</h3><p>Twin threats to time and space as campaigns by Kang and the Crown coincide! The Avengers fight the Set-serving Squadron Supreme in a clash between Earths and head for the nineteenth century to keep the West from getting wilder!

After having momentarily upset the Cosmic order of the Universe by eliminating <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> (only to restore the concept after realizing his mistake), the Beyonder decided that he might as well just destroy the entire universe because it confuses him.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805874\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.72360248447205\" data-width=\"966\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 966px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805874\"><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Beyonder\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 966w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Beyonder\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 966w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers vs. Beyonder</figcaption></figure><p>The Avengers attempted to intercept the Beyonder, but alone were no match for him and were easily defeated by the Beyonder within the blink of an eye. The Beyonder continued in his plot, in the process murdering the entirety of the New Mutants who attempted to stop him. The Avengers regrouped and called in assistance from the X-Men, Fantastic Four, Alpha Flight and many former Avengers, and attempted again to defeat the Beyonder but still proved insufficient to the task. It wasn't until the one-time villain the <a href=\"/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a> arrived that the tide changed for the heroes.</p><p>Battling against the Beyonder, the Molecule Man still wasn't powerful enough and required the heroes to also aid him in battle as a means of distracting the Beyonder from directing all his focus on him. Eventually, the Beyonder was defeated but it seemed too late as the cataclysmic battle between Beyonder and Molecule Man had seemingly doomed the planet to virtual destruction within mere hours.</p><p>Gravely weakened from his battle with the Beyonder, the Molecule Man was pleaded by the Avengers to fix the damage done to the planet in the battle. Not confident in his abilities or strength to do so, the Molecule Man took some convincing by the heroes but eventually rescinded to save the planet even if it meant the strain could kill him. The Molecule Man was successful but it appeared the strain had robbed him of his powers. The Avengers thanked him for his much needed help in the Beyonder conflict and allowed him to leave and live out his life with the Avengers promising not to pursue him for his former crimes.</p><p>Returning home, the Molecule Man revealed to the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> that he did indeed still have his powers and it was all a show for the Avengers because he was afraid if the Avengers knew his powers were still active they wouldn't stop hounding him or trying to get him to do something with his powers when all he wants to do is live a normal life with his wife. The Silver Surfer promised to keep the secret and left, the Avengers none the wiser.</p><h3>Absolute Vision</h3><p>Around this same time, Vision is nearly killed during a battle with <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a>. Starfox attempts to help Vision recuperate by connecting him to <a href=\"/isaac/4005-22002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22002\">I.S.A.A.C</a>., a powerful computer on his home world of <a href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\">Titan</a>. Though this does help with Vision's recovery, it also leads to him going mad and believing that the only way to save the world is to conquer it. To that end, he begins manipulating his teammates, and even engineers the formation of a spin-off group based in California, known as the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers</a>. Hawkeye leads the California based group, with the rest of the initial lineup consisting of <a href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\">Mockingbird</a>, the new Iron Man (<a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">James Rhodes</a>, who took over the role after Tony Stark suffered a severe alcohol relapse), <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra </a>and Wonder Man.</p><p>Though Vision's scheme is eventually thwarted, the West Coast branch of the Avengers remains active. Vision regains his sanity and steps down from the team to face the consequences of his actions, but not before the government begins placing increased scrutiny on the Avengers.</p><h3>Hydrobase</h3><p>Due to continued hassling from the government, the Avengers eventually lost their flight privileges within city limits. The team was soon contacted by the aquatic hero known as <a href=\"/stingray/4005-3320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3320\">Stingray</a>, who offered to let the Avengers use <a href=\"/avengers-island/4020-57019/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57019\">Hydrobase</a> to land and launch their Quinjets. It was at Hydrobase that the Avengers encountered their former foe Namor, who had since been ousted from his kingdom of Atlantis. Remembering how Namor fought alongside the Invaders during World War 2, Captain America offered the Atlantean membership in the Avengers in order to help redeem him.</p><h3>Betrayed</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6337765\" data-ratio=\"0.44241573033708\" data-width=\"712\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 712px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6337765\"><img alt=\"Both teams of Avengers together\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 712w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Both teams of Avengers together\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 712w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Both teams of Avengers together</figcaption></figure><p>When the East and West Coast Avengers teams meet for a baseball game, they're attacked by <a href=\"/freedom-force/4050-22698/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22698\">Freedom Force</a>, a government-sponsored team led by <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>. The Avengers are soon overpowered and taken into custody, and it is revealed that the government ordered that the heroes be arrested. The heroes are told that a former member of the team betrayed them and revealed that they were complicit in certain criminal actions, including Vision's earlier plot to conquer the planet. Though the Avengers plead their innocence, they are not believed.</p><p>After being released by <a href=\"/julia-carpenter/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Spider-Woman</a>, the Avengers set out to discover which of their former teammates betrayed them. After calling in several reserve members, the heroes learn that it was Quicksilver who turned against them and framed them for the crimes they are accused of. Quicksilver is revealed to have become mentally unhinged after his wife cheated on him, and also still harbors a grudge over the incident where he was unknowingly abandoned after the fight with the Sentinels. Quicksilver works with the members of <a href=\"/zodiac/4060-41170/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41170\">Zodiac</a> to destroy his old teammates, but is forced to flee after being thwarted.

The villains first began to discredit the Avengers by turning the public against Namor, with citizens soon expressing outrage at a violent former villain being allowed on the team. The villains later set a trap for Hercules and brutally beat him, nearly killing him. With the first phase of their plan complete, the Masters of Evil then stormed Avengers Mansion, and took several members of the team (including Captain America, Black Knight and Jarivs) prisoner.</p><p>With help from some reinforcements, the remaining Avengers were eventually able to reenter the mansion and rescue their comrades. During the final battle atop the mansion's roof, Baron Zemo fell from a great height, ending his threat. Though the Masters of Evil were ultimately defeated, Jarvis was severely injured, and ended up losing the use of one of his eyes for an extended period. The villains also destroyed Captain America's keepsakes from his youth, including the only remaining photograph of his deceased mother. Hercules was also rendered comatose due to his injuries.</p><p><a href=\"/doctor-druid/4005-10302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10302\">Doctor Druid</a>, a hero who had proven key in defeating the Masters of Evil, stayed on and joined the Avengers as an official member. Due to the damage inflicted on the mansion, the Avengers decided to relocate their entire operation to Hydrobase. Captain Marvel also ends up being appointed as team leader after Wasp takes a leave of absence.</p><h3>The X-Men vs. the Avengers</h3><p>Doctor Druid and Captain America arrive at a Mansfield, Ohio shopping mall, ordering the security guard to give the place their attention. They then force the crowd to listen to them and evacuate slowly, using Doctor Druid's hypnotic power. Up above the Earth's atmosphere, the rest of the Avengers, Captain Marvel, Thor, She-Hulk, and Black Knight, are attempting to stop a huge meteor shower. She-Hulk and Black Knight, in a Quinjet, nearly are killed, but are saved by Thor. The government realizes what the asteroids were when they see how magnetic it is, as well as the straps of metal embedded in it.</p><p>In Russia, the Soviet Super soldiers are stopping a runaway train with the help of the Crimson Dynamo. The Soviet Super-Soldiers express their hated of the man, but agree to let him join their ranks, as he is still Russian. In an isolated cove along the Atlantic shore, six X-Men are vacationing. (Dazzler, Magneto, Havok, Storm, Wolverine, and Rogue). All are enjoying themselves except for Havok, who is letting off steam. Magneto sneaks away from the group when he hears the announcement of the fallen asteroids, and takes off. Back at the Avengers Hydrobase, the team is discussing the Asteroids, which now have been revealed as pieces of Asteroid M. They all recount past deeds of him, and agree it is their duty to go after him. In Kampuchea, Magneto is looking for his lost pieces of Asteroid M when he is confronted by the Avengers, who want him to stop. The X-Men come to his aid when he is being beaten. Lastly, the Soviet Super-Soldiers come and attack both groups in an attempt to take Magneto for themselves.</p><p>After a quick recap, a three way battle erupts between the Avengers, Soviet Super Soldiers, and the X-Men. As the Soviets and Avengers duke it out, the X-Men take the opportunity to flee, taking Magneto with them. Dazzler stops Captain America and Crimson Dynamo after they attempt to follow her. After the X-Men escape, the Avengers trick Darkstar to trap all her teammates in her dark energy constructs, departing and leaving them all trapped for another hour by their own teammate. While they do this, Magneto departs the X-Men group to go look for the asteroid on his own. Captain Marvel spies on the X-Men's location using her powers, and relays it off to her team, the Avengers. Magneto finds a huge chunk of his asteroid, including one of his old costumes, and he puts his old helmet on. The Avengers arrive and attack him, nearly defeating him.</p><p>The X-Men then come to his aide, and as the two teams fight, Magneto tells them that the Asteroid is rigged with an explosion. Using the explosion as a distraction, Magneto takes the X-Men in their jet and flee, but apparently unknown to the X-Men, Doctor Druid is stowed away in the back of the Blackbird. The Soviet Super Soldiers, still trapped in the predicament from last issue, finally break free early, as Gremlin exits his armor and shakes Darkstar, releasing them from her powers. They all agree to go after Magneto once more, for his crimes long ago. On the Blackbird, the X-Men are discuss things. Magneto remains quiet about all the things going on with the Asteroid. Druid, still in the jet believes he is hiding something, and Magneto seems to realize that Druid is actually there. Druid then tries to make contact with the Avengers, before the X-Men attack him, as Magneto realized he was there. Rogue absorbs his powers and memories and tells them all that he didn't give away their location. All three teams then arrive in Singapore, after Druid awakens and alerts the Avengers.</p><p>Vanguard recognizes Havok in the streets, but is attacked by Wolverine before he can do anything. Rogue then absorbs his powers and memories and the entire X-Men team flees to a ship on the bay. There, Storm confronts Magneto.</p><p>The Soviets arrive at the ship and attack the X-Men, but during the battle, Crimson Dynamo purposely causes the ship to sink. The Avengers arrive, and all three teams assist in the evacuation of the boat. Crimson Dynamo's actions are revealed, and Magneto escapes once more. The Avengers barge into a Singapore office, demanding that they be given some sort of information on Mangeto. The government is tight-lipped, but the matter has become internation, so the Avengers demand they tell them. The leader is then called, and Magneto has been spotted. It is also revealed that the X-Men have turned themselves over.</p><p>Magneto is wandering the streets when someone recognizes him, causing something of a riot. He is found by three mutants, Crawler, Slider, and Leiko, who bring him to the Light. The Light finally trusts him that he is Magneto, and they all rejoice at his arrival, as they have been waiting for him. They are then attacked and Magneto helps them win, and then flees. The X-Men, tired of waiting to be either prosocuted or not, escape the van and fly away with it to freedom. The Avengers then meet with Mr. Ronalds, who is angry that the Avengers will not go after the escaped X-Men.</p><p>Magneto is modifying his helmet with Leiko, when the Avengers finally confront the X-Men, revealing that they were following them to attempt to find Magneto's location. Magneto teleports all Avengers but Captain America away, and consults with them. He surrenders himself to the government. Back at Xavier Mansion, Psylocke and Longshot watch the Magneto trial on television. The trial does not look to be going well on Magneto's side, and he is getting frustrated. It is revealed that Leiko and Slider were killed when Magneto was taken, and only Crawler lived form a riot attack. Magneto uses his helmet to set himself free from the trial, much to the people's anger.</p><h3>Nothing Lasts Forever</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336764\" data-ratio=\"1.5404208194906\" data-width=\"903\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 903px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336764\"><img alt=\"The final days of Captain Marvel's Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 903w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 623w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 415w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The final days of Captain Marvel's Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 903w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 623w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 415w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The final days of Captain Marvel's Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>The Avengers were eventually hunted down and captured by the Greek gods, and were brought before <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>, Hercules' father. Zeus blamed the Avengers for his son's injuries, and sought to punish the heroes by sentencing them to death by torture in the realm of Hades. However, the heroes fought back against Zeus' forces, and Hercules eventually recovered enough to dissuade his father from harming his friends. Though no longer in a coma, Hercules could not return to Earth with his teammates, and remained with his fellow gods to recover from his wounds. Upon their return to Earth, Namor's new wife <a href=\"/marrina/4005-12600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12600\">Marrina </a>was made a part of the team as an honorary Avenger. The Avengers later faced a team of robotic villains known as <a href=\"/heavy-metal/4060-55803/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55803\">Heavy Metal</a>.</p><p>Posing as the space pirate <a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a>, the time traveler <a href=\"/ravonna/4005-27265/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27265\">Ravonna</a> began influencing Doctor Druid, manipulating him into plotting a coup against Captain Marvel. Tragedy soon struck when Marrina's alien DNA caused her to transform into a gigantic monster known as the Leviathan. Namor was ultimately forced to kill Marrina to end her suffering, and left the Avengers in sorrow. The battle with Leviathan also left Captain Marvel badly wounded and near death, resulting in her resigning from the team. This allowed Doctor Druid to influence the other Avengers into electing him team leader, which was all part of Ravonna's plan.</p><p>The situation continued to get progressively worse as time went on, such as Black Knight falling victim to the curse of his <a href=\"/ebony-blade/4055-46939/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46939\">Ebony Blade</a>, and Ravonna brainwashing the team into helping her in her goals. This adventure resulted in Nebula and Doctor Druid disappearing into the time stream.

To combat this threat, Steve Rogers (known simply as The Captain at the time) assembled a team of reserve Avengers consisting of himself, Falcon, Beast, the Hulk (now using his Joe Fixit alias),<a href=\"/yellowjacket-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\"> Yellowjacket</a> and Hercules.

One team remains on Earth while the other two journey to the respective throneworlds of the Shi'ar and Kree to find some way of protecting Earth from this war. These space-bound teams are quickly embroiled in conspiracy within both alien empires. The Shi'ar team expose Skrull infiltrators deep within the Shi'ar ruling body, and the Kree team become fugitives as the Supreme Intelligence rises to rule the Kree once more. Even with the conspiracies becoming clear, the war continues with a life of its own. The Shi'ar complete their Nega-Bomb, an unprecedented weapon of mass destruction, and the Avengers are unable to stop Lilandra from deploying it against the Kree. Its detonation ends the war, killing millions upon millions of Kree.</p><p>The Avengers survive and discover the true architect of all this death is the Supreme Intelligence, who sacrificed countless lives so that the few surviving Kree would break free of their evolutionary dead end thanks to the Nega-Bomb's fallout.

Despite his powers, Thanos realizes his mission is near impossible. Remembering the Infinity Gems that were instrumental in his death, he peered into the Infinity Well to discover their secrets. He divines the true nature of the gems, and their current owners.</p><p>Thanos discovers that the Infinity Gems are currently in possession of the Elders of the Universe with the Soul Gem in possession of the In-Betweener. With cunning, Thanos is able to obtain possession of the gems. He then places the gems on the Infinity Gauntlet, and becomes the most powerful being in the universe.</p><p>Thanos immediately fulfills his objective and kills half of all life in the universe. He also brings a tortured Nebula (who alleges to be his granddaughter) as a sacrifice to Death. But because Thanos is so powerful, becoming superior to Death in every facet, Thanos' hope of being treated as an equal escapes his grasp.

Mephisto arrives and advises Thanos to remove his omniscience to make the fight somewhat fair in the hopes of impressing Death. Despite the machinations of Mephisto, the battle is grueling and over quickly for the heroes. Thanos dispatched the heroes with ease. Some examples of the carnage include Terraxia murdering Spider-Man and decapitating Iron Man. The X-men fared no better, as Wolverine had his adamantium skeleton turned to spongy rubber and Cyclops had his head trapped in a cube, stopping his optic blasts and suffocating him. Cosmic heroes like Nova was turned into small cubes, and with Quasar, Thanos causes the Quantum Bands upon his wrists to explode and then disintegrated him. Fearsome foes like Thor were turned to glass. The last man standing was Captain America, who made his last stand. Absent from the battle and light years away were the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock, who knew and fully expected the frontal assault to fail. The key to the real strategy was Mephisto's involvement. After shattering Captain America's shield, Thanos raised his fist to deliver the final blow. This was the cue for Adam Warlock's true plan to go into effect as Surfer rushed in to steal the gauntlet. This gambit failed, and Thanos realized how close he was to failure himself. He once again reinstated his omniscience, and became all-powerful, all-knowing once again.</p><p>It was then that the Cosmic forces themselves attacked. The mighty forces, each near-omnipotent on their own, were no match for the omnipotence the Infinity Gauntlet bestowed upon Thanos. Eternity and Thanos had a final epic battle where Thanos perseveres, becoming the embodiment of this universe's reality. Thanos sheds his mortal form and takes his place Eternity's replacement. Nebula seizes this opportunity to take the gauntlet from the former body of Thanos. Thanos realizes his error and joins with the remaining heroes and cosmic forces to defeat the now omnipotent Nebula. Their relentless attack on the confused Gauntlet wielder allows Adam Warlock to enter the Soul Gem, a gem he is intimately attached to. From within the Soul Gem he links with the other Infinity Gems and causes the gems to feedback on Nebula, causing her to remove it.</p><p>Adam Warlock then becomes wielder of the Gauntlet. In an attempt to be a \"perfect\" god, Warlock's first use of the power was to expel from his soul the Good and Evil. This was the first step to his reign as God. But before he can begin, the Living Tribunal appears and deems Warlock too unstable and therefore unfit to wield the power. He didn't appear previously because he knew that Thanos wouldn't upset the delicate balance of the universe. Without morals or vices, with his sole focus of being a god being undermined, Warlock violently reacts to the Living Tribunal's judgment. The Living Tribunal dismisses Warlock's uses of the Gauntlet and deems that they would no longer be able to function together, preventing anyone from achieving omnipotence through possession of the gems.

The Proctor uses these alternate heroes to form a team known as the <a href=\"/gatherers/4060-29919/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29919\">Gatherers</a>, who scour various parallel universes to find surviving heroes for his cause. The Avengers first encounter the Gatherer after being led into a trap by two <a href=\"/magdalene/4005-7251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7251\">Magdalene</a> and <a href=\"/swordsman-jarvert/4005-2504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2504\">Swordsman</a>, two members of the group.</p><p>The Avengers proceed to have further encounters with the Gatherers, including an incident where the villains try to kill Black Panther. The Avengers thwart this plan and take Swordsman prisoner, while the other Gatherers escape. The heroes learn that Swordsman is not actually a villain, and had been manipulated and lied to by the Proctor. Bothered by this setback, the Proctor arranges for Vision to be kidnapped and replaced by <a href=\"/anti-vision/4005-25908/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25908\">an alternate universe counterpar</a>t, who infiltrates the Avengers in order to kill Swordsman. The Avengers eventually discover the ruse, and confront the Proctor. Before escaping, the Proctor reveals to his Avengers that his world had been destroyed by its version of Sersi, who was driven mad by an Eternal mental deterioration known as the Mahd W'yry.</p><p>The Avengers become concerned that their version of Sersi may also be suffering from the Mahd W'yry, as she had become increasingly aggressive and erratic in the preceding weeks. This is not helped by her attraction to Black Knight, who is in love with Crystal. The love triangle is complicated even further by the return of Quicksilver, Crystal's husband, who has been staying at the mansion in order to recover from the injuries dealt to him by Exodus during the <a href=\"/bloodties/4045-42241/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42241\">Bloodties</a> incident. Sersi begins experiencing seizures and blackouts, and becomes the suspect in a murder investigation after several men she spoke to are found dead.</p><p>The Proctor eventually kidnaps Sersi and reveals that he was his world's version of Black Knight, and had fallen in love with his world's Sersi prior to her mental deterioration. After the alternate Sersei broke up with him and went insane, he killed her with the Ebony Blade, and began traveling across the <a href=\"/marvel-multiverse/4015-56201/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56201\">Multiverse</a>, killing each alternate version of Sersi he encountered. He also confesses that he had used the mental link he had with his world's Sersi to worsen this Sersi's mental state, and also killed the young men to frame her.</p><p>The Avengers arrive to rescue their teammate and end up in a battle with the Gatherers. Sersi eventually frees herself and uses the Ebony Blade to kill the Proctor, an act which shocks her teammates. Realizing that the Mahd W'yry will soon consume her, Sersi opts to leave for the <a href=\"/ultraverse/4015-49479/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-49479\">Ultraverse</a>, a reality where she will no longer experience her illness. Black Knight chooses to go with her, having realized that he loves her, and that Crystal will never be his.

After subduing the two mutant villains, the Avengers rush off to the final battle with Onslaught, who has evolved into an even more powerful form. During the final battle, the Hulk manages to crack Onslaught's armor, transforming the creature into a being of pure psionic energy. Realizing that the energy needs physical form in order to be destroyed, Thor sacrifices himself to try and hold Onslaught. The Fantastic Four, Captain America, Wasp, Giant-Man, Black Panther, Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Namor, Hawkeye, Crystal and Bruce Banner (after having been separated from the Hulk) follow Thor's lead, giving up their lives to contain Onslaught. With Onslaught trapped, the X-Men combine their attacks to finish him off, destroying him.</p><p>In the aftermath, the world mourns the fallen Avengers. Black Widow (who had been leading the team at the time of the battle with Onslaught) suffers intense guilty over the deaths, but resolves to carry on the team's legacy. She attempts to form a new line-up of Avengers, and approaches Angel, Iceman, <a href=\"/ant-man-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a>, She-Hulk, <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> and War Machine, but is rejected by each of them. With the founding Avengers gone, two congressmen file a motion to annul the team's government charter, causing an even greater strain. Black Widow ultimately chooses to officially disband the Avengers, and shuts down the mansion. Several former members of the team (namely Black Knight, She-Hulk and Hercules) later leave to form the new <a href=\"/heroes-for-hire/4060-23588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes for Hire</a>.

The Avengers manage to restore the cities after thwarting the plans of Scorpio, the mastermind behind the disappearances.</p><p>As a result of the leadership displayed by the Avengers, they are once again granted United Nations clearance, with Avengers Mansion becoming Avengers Embassy.

When a group of peasants are brutally murdered by their own Slokovian government because they worship Thor, Thor is furious and comes down to earth from Asgard to avenge those people.

The intervention of Hawkeye and the Hulk eventually allows the heroes to resolve the crisis, and She-Hulk is returned to normal.

Believing this to be unconstitutional, Captain America escapes Government capture and gathers others to fight with him against the SHRA. Iron Man, in contrast, believes the SHRA was the best way to keep the public safe and keep all superheroes accountable for their own actions and worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. to help capture Captain America. This divided the super-human community, which literally became a super-human <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>, leading to multiple conflicts between Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. with Cap's \" <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a>,\" and left friendships and relationships broken, familirs divided, friends turned into bitter enemies, and the death of few individuals, such as Bill Foster, Goliath. The war only ended when Captain America finally surrendered after seeing the harm the war was doing, but this only ended in more bloodshed as Captain America was <a href=\"/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america/4045-54540/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-54540\">assassinated</a> shortly after surrendering.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-160532\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-160532\"><img alt=\"The people's Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" data-width=\"482\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The people's Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" data-width=\"482\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The people's Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>For further details: <a href=\"/the-initiative/4045-53970/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-53970\">the Initiative</a></p><p>Minutes after this new Avengers team had been assembled, New York City came under attack by the <a href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\">Mole Man</a>'s monsters and the Mighty Avengers were called into action..</p><p>The battle against the Mole Man's forces went well even though it forced the new team to work out the kinks of its new group dynamic in the field, but the crisis took a terrible swerve with the unexpected arrival of <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a>. Ultron hacked into Iron Man's new Extremis system and not only overrode Tony Stark but physically transformed him into a nude replica of Janet Van Dyne. Ultron's fixation with the Wasp became so warped that he turned himself into her as an expression of his love, making himself into a herself. Ultron also hacked into Tony Stark's unfinished network of weather control satellites, causing natural disasters all over the world with the intent of making Earth inhospitable to human life. When the Mighty Avengers discovered this, Wonder Man and the Sentry quickly destroyed the satellites. Ultron then switched tactics and began decoding missile launch codes while fighting the team. Only one missile was successfully launched, and Ms. Marvel detonated it safely in the air. With the help of <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a>, Ares was shrunk down and hand-delivered a virus to Ultron's A.I. core, wiping out Ultron and safely returning Tony Stark's body and mind.</p><h3>Outlaws</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336724\" data-ratio=\"1.5037593984962\" data-width=\"532\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 532px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336724\"><img alt=\"The New Avengers after Civil War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg 532w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Avengers after Civil War\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg 532w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336724-new%20avengers%20cast.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New Avengers after Civil War</figcaption></figure><p>Following the events of<em> Civil War</em>, the line-up of the New Avengers was changed. With Iron Man, Ms. Marvel and Sentry no longer being part of the group, and Captain America being dead, the team was initially underpowered. However, their ranks were soon joined by <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, who allowed the Avengers to use the <a href=\"/sanctum-sanctorum/4020-55966/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55966\">Sanctum Sanctorum</a> as their new base of operations. <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, Luke's longtime friend and former crime-fighting partner, also joined the team during this period.</p><p>Clint Barton later returned to New York after having been resurrected by Scarlet Witch following the events of <em>House of M</em>. With his Hawkeye identity having been taken over by Kate Bishop after his \"death,\" Clint was left without a costume or moniker. He eventually took the Ronin name and costume that had previously been used by Echo, and switched from his trademark bow and arrow to a katana. As Ronin, Clint joined the New Avengers, and took part in many of their adventures.</p><p>The New Avengers once again clashed with the Hand after learning that they had kidnapped Echo and were planning to brainwash her. During the ensuing battle, <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, the leader of the Hand, attempted to kill Doctor Strange. However, at the last moment, Echo snapped out of her brainwashed state and stabbed Elektra with a katana, killing her. However, after her death, the assassin's body transformed into a green-skinned alien, revealing that the woman who had been thought to be Elektra was actually a shape-shifting <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull</a><a href=\"/elektra-pagon/4005-54515/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54515\"> impostor</a>.

To that end, information was leaked that <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> was alive and in a holding facility. None of this was true. It was bait to lure the New Avengers into a trap, and it worked. The New Avengers suddenly found themselves facing off against the Mighty Avengers. Rather than a fight, Iron Man activated a neural net device meant to dampen their powers. It worked, but the Mighty Avengers did not count on Doctor Strange being with Luke's team. The device did not work on his magic, which allowed Strange to teleport the New Avengers back to his home, which was mystically disguised as a vacant building.</p><p>No one on the Mighty Avengers could see through the illusion Dr. Strange had cast upon his home, but that did not mean they believed it. They recruited <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\">Brother Voodoo</a>'s assistance to break the illusion, but he was unable to defeat Dr. Strange's magics and admitted as much to the team.

This weapon was based off of the <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom symbiote</a>, releasing a plague of symbiotes that transformed the population of New York into Venom-like monsters. The Mighty Avengers and the New Avengers worked together to fight off the threat as several of their own members became infected. They held the city together as best they could until Iron Man could develop and release a cure to the plague. Rather than arrest the New Avengers, the Mighty Avengers team ignored their presence and focused only on damage control.</p><p>Iron Man investigated the source of the symbiote bomb and traced it straight back to Dr. Doom. It did not matter whether the attack was intentional or not. The Mighty Avengers led a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> attack on Dr. Doom in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, taking the fight straight to him in his castle.

When his technological defenses failed against the Mighty Avengers, he resorted to his magic and nearly had them all at his mercy. However, nothing he could do would protect him from the Sentry's sheer power. He was brutally defeated and unmasked.

A Skrull ship crashed in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>, setting off enough planetary alarms as it went down to alert the Mighty Avengers. The team prepared to investigated but was delayed by the New Avengers, who stole the <a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/4055-53156/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53156\">quinjet</a> to investigate the crash site themselves rather than trust the Mighty Avengers to do it. By the time the Mighty Avengers caught up, Luke Cage and the others were already at the crashed ship. Iron Man wanted them to hold off on doing anything, but Luke still had Iron Man pegged as a Skrull and wanted answers he thought were inside the ship. What they found inside appeared to be a large group of heroes who had been abducted years ago, including another Iron Man and another Ms. Marvel.</p><p>The Skrulls' trap for both Avengers teams was sprung, and Ares called it correctly. He warned the others that this was a distraction from the true battle, and that as many of them as possible should get back to civilization. Iron Man was quickly incapacitated by a Skrull virus, and the other heroes were itching for a fight. Chaos broke out, and everyone was suddenly scattered throughout the Savage Land. Only Ms. Marvel made it out and flew straight to New York, where she engaged the army of Super-Skrulls attacking the city. Back in the Savage Land, Iron Man continued to suffer from the virus and Spider-Woman revealed herself as a Skrull to him. She tried to get him to believe that he was a sleeper Skrull agent and made all this possible, but Black Widow intervened and assured Iron Man otherwise. The paranoia and chaos in the Savage Land would have continued indefinitely had <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a> and <a href=\"/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand</a> not arrived with the means to identify the Skrulls and get the two Avengers teams to New York.</p><p>In Central Park, the Mighty Avengers gathered with the New Avengers, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a>, the <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\">Secret Warriors</a>, <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Captain America</a> and the Thunderbolts for a climatic battle against Queen Veranke and her Skrull forces. The Skrulls had one last surprise, though. The growth serum previously given to Wasp by a Skrull posing as Hank Pym was actually a biological weapon, turning her into a living bomb that the Skrulls now triggered. They were willing to kill themselves along with the humans rather than be beaten. As Wasp grew uncontrollably and was on the verge of detonation, Thor used <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a> to transport her to another dimension, where she could die peacefully without taking anyone with her. The tide then turned against the Skrulls, and the invasion was repelled.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336726\" data-ratio=\"0.77\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336726\"><img alt=\"The New Avengers vs. the Dark Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 500w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Avengers vs. the Dark Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 500w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New Avengers vs. the Dark Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>After the invasion, politics kicked in and Iron Man took the fall for all of the mistakes that allowed the Skrulls to infiltrate so severely, and because <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> not only saved Washington D.C. but took the shot that killed Queen Veranke, he was given Iron Man's job. This meant Iron Man's Avengers was now Norman Osborn's Avengers.</p><p>Iron Man was forced to go on the run to protect the list of superhuman identities from Osborn. Wonder Man became completely disillusioned with the Avengers and people in general. Black Widow went underground with her lover, the new Captain America. Ms. Marvel was invited to become part of Osborn's Avengers, but she refused and went renegade with the New Avengers. Ares and the Sentry stayed on to serve under Osborn.</p><p>With Osborn in charge, the Mighty Avengers gave way to the <a href=\"/dark-avengers/4060-55990/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\">Dark Avengers</a>, a group consisting largely of former villains masquerading as Earth's mightiest heroes. The group included Daken (posing as Wolverine), Moonstone (posing as Ms. Marvel), Venom (posing as Spider-Man) and Bullseye (posing as Hawkeye). The roster was rounded out by former Might Avengers Sentry and Ares, as well as <a href=\"/noh-varr/4005-11565/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11565\">Marvel Boy</a> (now known as Captain Marvel).</p><h3>Earth's Mightiest</h3><p>Early into the days of Osborn's <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a>, chaotic and unexplainable events began occurring all over the world. The seas boiled, Philadelphia overran with deadly plant life and San Francisco became encased in amber. All of it was the result of <a href=\"/modred-the-mystic/4005-13924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13924\">Modred</a> using the <a href=\"/the-darkhold/4055-45058/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45058\">Darkhold</a> to raise <a href=\"/chthon/4005-15683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15683\">Chthon</a> in <a href=\"/wundagore-mountain-transia/4020-41286/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Wundagore</a>. <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a> figured out where the source of the chaos was and, along with <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, sought to pull together an Avengers team to confront it. They tracked down <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a> first, because they considered him crucial to any Avengers team. In turn, Jarvis directed them to Hank Pym.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> saw opportunity for mischief. He disguised himself as the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> and began teleporting away specific heroes, including the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">U.S. Agent</a>, <a href=\"/stature/4005-40516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Stature</a> and <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a>. Like Cho, Iron Man also figured out the pattern and headed for Wundagore.</p><p>Much to Pym's annoyance, the collected heroes fell under the leadership of Iron Man when they all gathered in Wundafore. However, the situation was dire and he was not inspiring much confidence by calling himself the Wasp now. Modred succeeded in raising Chthon and used the body of <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> as host. However, as the situation continued to escalate, it was Pym who figured out how to neutralize Chthon and pull the entity out of Quicksilver's body. Iron Man left afterward, having to deal with his own problems with Osborn. But the situation inspired Pym, and he asked the remaining heroes to join him in a new incarnation of the Mighty Avengers. The Hulk refused, as did Quicksilver. The rest agreed, and Quicksilver changed his mind upon seeing who he believed to be his sister aiding the team.</p><p>Quickly, Hank Pym took his new team on a spree of adventures, solving crises all over the world. This brought the unwelcome attention of Norman Osborn and <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> because it was hurting Osborn's image to have another Avengers team out there beyond his control. Pym's status as a founding Avenger also brought up questions of legitimacy when it came to which Avengers team was the real Avengers. Much of this growing conflict was due to Loki, who guided the Mighty Avengers from crisis to crisis under the guise of the Scarlet Witch.</p><p>H.A.M.M.E.R. was eventually able to locate the access door to Pym's secret lab while the team was out on another mission. Only Jocasta and Jarvis were present to deal with the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents at the door, and they were forced to detach Pym's lab from it, sending it adrift in reality. Meanwhile, Pym was approached with an offer from a global agency called <a href=\"/grampa/4060-56485/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56485\">G.R.A.M.P.A.</a> that would authorize the Avengers' activities in several states outside of Osborn's influence.</p><p>To repair his lab and save his experiments, Pym required a device <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Bill Foster</a> invented. The problem was that when Foster died the device was left to <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Ben Grimm</a>, and Mr. Fantastic did not trust Pym with the device due to all the emotional stresses he was under. In response, Pym led his team on a raid of the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a> to take the device. As the Mighty Avengers and <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> fought, Pym and Mr. Fantastic grappled over Bill Foster's device. Eventually, Pym was able to show Mr. Fantastic the experiment he was working on that he wanted so badly to save, and upon seeing the preserved body of Janet Van Dyne in the dimension Thor had sent her, Mr. Fantastic agreed to let Pym have the device.</p><h3>Unspeakable</h3><p>In China, a powerful and forgotten Inhuman king now known only as <a href=\"/the-unspoken/4005-63591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63591\">the Unspoken</a> sought a device known as the Slave Engine. Many years ago, he hid this holy Inhuman relic and refused to ever tell where it was. Now, he wanted to make use of it himself. The Slave Engine was capable of releasing a gas like the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\">Terrigen Mists</a>, except it had the effect of devolving humans into <a href=\"/alpha-primitives/4060-55902/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55902\">Alpha Primitives</a>. The Unspoken's intent was to enslave Earth's population and win back the favor of the Inhuman people. At first, only U.S. Agent, Quicksilver and the<a href=\"/peoples-defense-force/4060-56647/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56647\">People's Defense Force</a> stood in his way. They were not enough.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hank Pym disappeared during an experiment into the <a href=\"/macroverse/4020-56470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56470\">Macroverse</a>, and during this time, he believed <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a> spoke to him and chose him to be the Scientist Supreme of Earth over Tony Stark and Reed Richards.</p><p>In order to combat the Unspoken, the Mighty Avengers gathered as much Avengers from other teams as they could find. Members of the New Avengers, <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/avengers-resistance/4060-57031/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57031\">Avengers Resistance</a> came to China to help, but many fell under the effects of the Slave Engine, becoming Alpha Primitives loyal to the Unspoken. Soon, Hank Pym joined the fight as well, and the crisis was successfully brought under control.</p><h3>Mighty No Longer</h3><p>Suspicions about the Scarlet Witch had steadily been rising, but it was not until an altercation with the Dark Avengers that the team realized what was truly going on. Loki was impersonating the Scarlet Witch. Wanting answers, Pym created the means to not only trap Loki but torture the god for answers. While being questioned, Loki confessed to manipulating the team, including posing as Eternity and naming Pym as Scientist Supreme to play on his ego. All the while, Loki sent out a call to <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> for aid, and when Thor arrived, the god of thunder was enraged with the treatment of his half-brother. He demanded Loki's release, and the Mighty Avengers complied since many of them were also uncomfortable with the actions Pym had taken.</p><p>Adding to the growing misgivings about Pym, he requested that Loki become a member of the Mighty Avengers. This was the breaking point for the team. All of them lost what faith they had in him and left, effectively dissolving the Mighty Avengers.</p><h3><b>Siege</b></h3><p>In <a href=\"/siege/4045-55985/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55985\">Siege</a>, bringing his Dark Reign to its climax, Norman Osborn has one last objective to complete: bringing down <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a>. Teaming up with the villain, Loki, Norman frames the Asgardian <a href=\"/volstagg/4005-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3513\">Volstagg</a>, giving himself an excuse to attack. Norman then leads his \"Avengers\" on an all out assault on Asgard, and the first hero to fall in the battle is none other then Thor.</p><p>As the battle rages on, Ares learns of Norman's lies and decides to join his fellow god's into battling Osborn's forces. <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a> then rescues Thor from Norman's men, and helps him escape back into town to heal. Back at the Avengers hideout in Brooklyn, the newly returned Steve Rogers, in uniform, rallies the New and Young Avengers along with Nick Fury and his <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\">Secret Warriors,</a> and they then head to Asgard. Back in Asgard, Ares has a change of heart and finds and attacks Norman, but is stopped by Sentry, who, after a short struggle rips Ares in half, killing him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2883774\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5131578947368\" data-width=\"988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2883774\"><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Thunderbolts by Wellinton Alves\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 634w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Thunderbolts by Wellinton Alves\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 634w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers vs. Thunderbolts by Wellinton Alves</figcaption></figure><p>By the time Norman Osborn attacked <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a>, the Avengers were no longer officially together, but this did not prevent Amadeus Cho from trying to get as much of the band back together as possible to aid the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Asgardians</a>. Stature and Vision were already on their way along with the rest of the Young Avenges and others <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a> had assembled. Cho was able to hitch a ride to Asgard with U.S. Agent, and his message also reached Quicksilver. Unfortunately, Hercules had recently died in the <a href=\"/assault-on-new-olympus/4045-55997/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55997\">assault on New Olympus</a>.</p><p>Hank Pym dismissed Steve Rogers' call to arms, staying in his lab with Jocasta to continue his experiment on Janet. However, <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> invaded the <a href=\"/infinite-avengers-mansion/4020-56336/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56336\">Infinite Avengers Mansion</a>, forcing Pym to abandon his experiment to deal with Ultron.</p><p>In Asgard, the rest of the former Mighty Avengers gathered to prevent the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> from stealing <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a>'s spear for Osborn. Cho realized that it was <a href=\"/ghost/4005-17638/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17638\">Ghost</a> who sent out the initial warning about what Osborn was up to, and they were able to prevent Osborn from getting the spear thanks to the defections of <a href=\"/paladin/4005-10584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\">Paladin</a> and<a href=\"/eric-ogrady/4005-6774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Ant-Man</a>.

Norman then calls on <a href=\"/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\">The Hood</a> and his gang to join the battle. In the town, Young Avenger Speed locates Tony Stark and gives him the briefcase that <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a> gave Cap before they left.

The Sentry causes <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> to break apart and fall to Broxton. Norman's suit then falls apart, revealing his now Green Goblin deformed face to the Avengers and to the news team who are filming the whole thing, showing Osborn's true face to the world. Norman then tells the heroes that they don't know what they've done, that he's the only one who can control the Sentry, he then points up to the skies where the <a href=\"/void/4005-11585/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11585\">Void</a> is now, Norman then tells them that they are all dead.</p><p>The Avengers do their best to fight off the Void, but they are quickly overpowered by him. Only with the help of Loki who begged Odin for the Norn Stones, did the Avengers gain the power of the stones. Now powered up, the Avengers took the fight straight to the Void, gaining the upper hand, but this new power-up was short lived as the Void seemly kills Loki, taking away the heroes new found power. Iron Man takes control of the H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier, turning it into a giant bullet, and ramming it into the Void. The heroes find Bob begging them to kill him, but he soon reverts back into the Void, only to be finally struck down by Thor, Thor then takes the Sentry's body and throws it into the sun.</p><h3>The Heroic Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2831982\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.77061855670103\" data-width=\"1940\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2831982\"><img alt=\"Avengers by Olivier Coipel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 1940w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers by Olivier Coipel\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 1940w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers by Olivier Coipel</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/the-heroic-age/4045-56023/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56023\">The Heroic Age</a>, the President gives Steve Rogers Norman Osborn's job as America's Top Cop, Steve accepts, but tells the President that he's going to do things his way.

Without hesitation, Thor lands a blow on him, and throws him off the building. The Avengers quickly go after Kang, who holds a mysterious device. It is a device that Iron Man conceived, but never got to actually create: a doomsday machine.

Sam Alexander, the new Nova, crash landed on earth to deliver a warning to the Avengers that the Phoenix Force is on it's way to Earth. Later the Avengers travel to Utopia and ask Cyclops to hand over Hope so they can put her in protective custody, but the latter refuses since he believes Hope will save the mutant race from extinction and orders Captain America to leave.</p><p>After a brief scuttle Captain America assembles the Avengers on Utopia and a war breaks out between the two teams. Emma Frost places Hope under the protection of the Five Lights until the matter is resolved, but Hope refuses believing she is the cause of this war and knocks out the Lights. Spider-man and Wolverine enter the compound to get her but they are immediately overwhelmed by her rising Phoenix powers.</p><p>Meanwhile Thor leads the secret Avengers in space to stop the Phoenix but they are soon defeated. The Avengers and the X-men travel around the world to search for Hope. Iron Man and Giant Man prepare a weapon to kill the Phoenix, while both teams fight on the Blue Area of the Moon; Hope is starting to lose control of the Phoenix and asks Wolverine to kill her. Iron Man, sporting a new armor, shoots the Phoenix but instead of killing it it separates it into fragments which bond with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik, and Colossus.</p><p>They defeat the Avengers with their new found powers and head back to earth with Hope. Now the Phoenix Five reform the world according to their will by supplying free energy, food, water, as well as ending armed conflicts around the world. The Avengers believe the power is corrupting them and got to Utopia to get Hope, when they do they are nearly beaten by Cyclops but managed to escape thanks to the Scarlet Witch. Cyclops had enough and declares that he will no longer tolerate the Avengers by saying,\"No more Avengers.\"</p><p>The X-Men begin hunting down the Avengers around the world while the latter hides and think of a counter attack. Sooner or later some members of the Avengers are captured and imprisoned by the X-Men. During a confrontation between the two teams the Scarlet Witch injures Magik while Emma Frost severely burns Hawkeye, the Five heal Hawkeye and Cyclops reprimands them for their use of excessive force, but Magik defends that they must kill the Scarlet Witch and Namor reminds him that they are at war.</p><p>Meanwhile Black Panther and Iron Man try to find a way to stop the Phoenix Five, while Hope is taken to K'un L'un for training, and to everyone's surprise it is Spider-Man who must train her. While fighting the Scarlet Witch injures Namor, furious he goes against Cyclops's orders and attacks Wakanda with the Atlanteans. After a long and arduousbattle the Avengers finally bring down Namor, but Cyclops and the rest of the Phoenix avatars arrive and a portion of Namor's Phoenix powers are absorbed and divided into the remaining avatars.</p><p>As days pass by, more and more Avengers are captured by the Phoenix Five, and Hope's training in K'un-L'un shows no results. Several X-Men feel uncomfortable about the way the Phoenix Five are treating their prisoners. Storm arrives in Wakanda in the aftermath of Namor's assault and tells Black Panther that the captured Avengers are being held prisoner in a volcano in Siberia. The Avengers then lead a rescue mission with the help of Storm and Professor X to break out their comrades but are stopped by Magik and Colossus. Spider-Man baits Magik and Colossus into taking each other out, allowing the Avengers to escape. As the Avengers arrive back in K'un-L'un, they are surprised by Cyclops, strengthened by half of Magik and Colossus's portions of the Phoenix force.</p><p>The Avengers stall Cyclops as Hope retreats to find Lei Kung, who tells her that he has one final lesson and presents Shao Lao the dragon, the source of the Iron Fist energy. Hope absorbs the dragon's energy and manages to stave off Cyclops's advance. She falls back behind the Scarlet Witch and with a combination of both their powers, Hope sends Cyclops to the Moon. On the Moon, Cyclops comes to the realization that he will need Emma Frost's power as well in order to defeat Hope. Meanwhile on Utopia, Magneto asks Professor X for his help as Emma Frost's rule becomes more tyrannical.</p><p>Cyclops then absorbs Emma Frost's power and becomes the Dark Phoenix while also killing Professor X. The X-Men and Avengers team up to stop Cyclops but even with their combined might they are no match for Scott's godly powers. As a last resort Hope and Scarlet Witch team up and defeat Cyclops, the Phoenix enters Hope's body and, with the Scarlet Witch, wish away the Phoenix erasing the Dark Phoenix, and restore the mutant population.

Using the diagram, Cap recruited a new team including cosmic-level heroes: <a href=\"/smasher-kane/4005-86443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86443\">Smasher</a>, <a href=\"/hyperion/4005-6911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6911\">Hyperion</a>, <a href=\"/manifold/4005-62072/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62072\">Manifold</a>, and the current <a href=\"/tamara-devoux/4005-88135/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88135\">Captain Universe</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Surprisingly, Ex Nihilo and Abyss agreed to not spread their experiments to Earth, mostly in respect to Captain Universe’s power. However, their interference was already having consequences. One of their test subjects attacked and killed <a href=\"/omega-flight/4060-31159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31159\">Omega Flight</a>, while another was being taken advantage of by AIM, who were also aggressively expanding their membership and power. A new <a href=\"/white-event/4015-56185/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56185\">White Event</a> also occurred choosing a new <a href=\"/nightmask/4005-88156/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88156\">Nightmask</a> and <a href=\"/star-brand/4005-30118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30118\">Starbrand</a>, both of whom joined the Avengers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest threat came from deep space. Captain Universe warned her current team of <a href=\"/builders/4060-60019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60019\">The Builders</a>, ancient beings created by Captain Universe. They were considered perfect beings that cultivated civilizations and directed evolutionary paths of multiple planets. They sought to destroy planets that had significance to incursions, the collision of variant planets from the multiverse. On Captain Universe’s recommendation, E Nihilo and Abyss were extended membership to the team</p><h3>Infinity</h3><p>With alien empires falling to The Builders, The Avengers ventured into space to join the likes of the Kree, the Skrulls, the Shi’ar, and even the <a href=\"/annihilation-wave/4060-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55905\">Annihilation Wave</a> to take on The Builders together. Their plan was to trap The Builders in a singularity, but they were unprepared for the size of their fleet, which now included members of Ex Nihilo’s race. With half of the Avengers as prisoners of The Builders, they were impressed by the varied resources and abilities, making Earth their prime target. Alien empires began defecting or retreating for leniency, but Ex Nihilo was able to convince his race to fight for the Avengers. Together, they summoned Captain Universe, who destroyed The Builders and earned the admiration of the galaxy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thanos learned that the Infinity Gems were with the Illuminati and targeted an Earth left vulnerable while the Avengers were in space. He was also hunting one of his offspring, <a href=\"/thane/4005-92620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92620\">Thane</a>, whom he considered an Inhuman abomination. He was joined by his new generals, <a href=\"/black-order/4060-59877/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59877\">The Black Order</a>, and the feral <a href=\"/outriders/4060-59774/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59774\">Outriders</a>. To stand against them, Luke Cage put together his own Avengers team, while they waited for the main Avengers to return from space, and Black Bolt readied a Terrigen Bomb, that would released terrigen mist into Earth’s atmosphere. This bomb would trigger the dormant Inhuman genes in small percent of the population, including Thane. Ultimately, the Avengers arrived with troops from grateful alien civilizations to take on Thanos’ space navy, while Thane used his new Inhuman ability to freeze Thanos as a living statue.</p><h3>AXIS</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8634503\" data-ratio=\"1.5372233400402\" data-width=\"1988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8634503\"><img alt=\"Inverted Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 1988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 1249w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Inverted Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 1988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 1249w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8634503-ezgif-2-13d6ee459e.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Inverted Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>To get an edge over his rivals, Red Skull plundered Xavier’s grave and spliced Xavier’s telepathic brain onto his own.

Lashing out, Red Skull upgraded to Red Onslaught. To reach the moral center of Xavier’s brain, Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom cast a spell that inverted his morality. Unfortunately, it backfired and inverted the morality of a number of the heroes who were confronting Red Skull.</p><p>An inverted Avengers, including Sam Wilson (acting Captain America), Iron Man, Thor, and Scarlet Witch executed the Red Skull for his crimes and tricked the non-inverted heroes into a trap so they won’t stand in the inverted team’s way. Spider-Man, Nova, and a de-powered Steve Rogers escaped the inverted Avengers and joined a team of inverted supervillains, led by Magneto. They evaded capture while strategizing their next move thanks to the inverted Avengers being distracted by inverted X-Men.</p><p>Those inverted X-Men had planned a gene bomb that would take out anyone with an X-gene, leaving mutants as the dominant race on Earth. Rogers and Spidey led the inverted supervillains against the inverted X-Men to stop the bomb from going off. They were no match for the inverted X-Men, however, they were still able to reduce the damage of the bomb when an inverted <a href=\"/carnage/4005-1490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1490\">Carnage</a> smothered it with its symbiote tendrils, costing Carnage his life.

They were ready to make their stand when the Squadron tracked them to Wakanda.</p><p>The two teams were pretty evenly matched, but that all changed when President Coulson entered the battlefield with his Pandemonium Cube, the artifact Mephisto gave Coulson to remake the world.

A <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"><b>Skrull</b></a> posing as <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\"><b>Black Panther</b></a> easily found out information about the Avengers fighting against the Skrull army. Once the Avengers found out that a Skrull was impersonating their fellow teammate and friend, the Avengers took him down and freed the real Black Panther. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"><b>Iron Man</b></a> created ID cards for the Avengers so that they can have access to the mansion instead of outsiders (people outside of the team) could just walk in. Throughout the years the ID cards have gotten more advanced and are currently used by mostly all of the branching Avenging teams (e.g. <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\"><b>Secret Avengers</b></a> ). The ID Cards were also created for the days during the superhero fight for freedom called <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"><b>Civil War</b></a> - as a reminder for heroes to keep their cards at all cost or suffer being thrown into the <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\"><b>Negative Zone</b></a> .</p><p>Though the ID Cards have come in handy, mostly any super powered villain could steal one from an Avenger member and use a shape-shifter to pose as that hero. So Iron Man (teamed with other genius heroes) made a card that needs the Avengers retina scanned. The look and ideal of the ID Card has changed throughout the years, but it is one of the Avengers greatest tools at keeping their secrets safe.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><p>In this alternate reality, the Avengers are infected by a virus that turns everyone into a zombie who craves for flesh no matter what.

That was the motivation that spurred him to create his \"Master Mold\", a servitor/controller that would command the many 'Sentinels' that Trask would create later. Unfortunately the A.I. it had been given, began to grow exponentially and Master Mold became sentient, and made sure his progeny acquired this ability also. Ironically, unbeknownst to Trask he had fathered two children who would grow up to become mutants: Tanya (and Lawrence) who had the ability of time travel and due to the instability of her power became lost in the timestream.</p><p>When Bolivar discovered that Lawrence was 'gifted' with precognition, he went to great lengths to create a device that would cloak his son's genetic ability (from his guardians) and hid it within an amulet, that he gave Lawrence, after Bolivar realized his son had predicted his wife's death. Trask had created humanity's guardian in <a href=\"/master-mold/4005-10254/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10254\">Master Mold</a>, but had not factored in Sentinel Logic in problem-solving, \"We were created to be the Guardians of Mankind - and to guard them properly we must RULE them completely\".</p><p>Master Mold commanded the existing Sentinels to capture their creator and return with him, So that he could commence the creation of a vast army of Sentinels with the intention of World domination. Trask, after witnessing Beast's interrogation under the Psycho-probe, realized that it was he, who had created the threat. To right His Wrong, in a attempt to destroy Master Mold, he sacrificed himself by triggering a catastrophic explosion. The X-Men barely escaped, Bolivar was found by his son, who, from that day blamed Mutants (specifically the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> ) for his father's demise, and made it his project, to vastly improve on his father's design, initially converting the Mk I's then eventually creating the superior Mark II Sentinels. They could identify/determine a mutant's power from a distance due to an encyclopaedic database and advanced scanning equipment, and could conceive a plan to nullify/neutralize all mutant powers/attacks, and incapacitate any opponent.</p><p>Judge Chalmers (a close family friend) abhorred by Lawrence's extreme solution, (and privy to the family secret) decided to shock his young ward by snatching the amulet about his neck (That, to that day had hidden his presence from his servitors) No longer masked by the amulet, his former servitors, apprehended Trask and followed his last order as their leader, \"<b>Secure</b> All Mutants in area - - and <b>DESTROY</b> them\", Needless to say the X-Men triumphed and saved the Day. In a future confrontation with his creations, Lawrence became involved, when Quicksilver used him, to locate his sister, the Scarlet Witch, who had been abducted by Sentinels, (lead by their (unbeknownst to them) Now mutated leader, No. 2, recently returned from their aborted mission to the Sun) in their latest scheme to rid the world of Mutants.

antagonists of the film. In the movie, it is revealed that the earliest models of Sentinels were developed by Bolivar Trask during the early 1970's, but after Trask was murdered by <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>, the machines were upgraded by integrating the shape-shifting mutant's DNA.</p><p>By 2023, the Sentinels have wiped out most of the human race and can now adapt and counteract any mutant superpower. With the X-Men hopelessly outmatched, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde </a>sends <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine </a>back in time to prevent Trask's assassination and stop the Sentinel program from ever taking off. The young <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> manages to hijack the Sentinels and uses them to attack Washington, D.C., but is stopped by Mystique, who is convinced by <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier </a>to spare Trask's life. As a result, Trask is discredited and arrested for leaking military secrets, which leads to the dark, Sentinel-controlled future never coming to pass since the Sentinel project is scrapped following Trask's incarceration.</p><p>In the movie, the original 1970's Sentinels resemble more realistic versions of their comic counterparts, while the futuristic Sentinels deviate more heavily. According to designer John Myhre, this was to allow the Sentinels to change their size and shape in order to adapt to any threat. They were intended to be the closest thing to a live action version of Nimrod. The future Sentinels were strong enough to easily rival Colossus in brute strength, with 2 of them being capable of ripping him in half. They were also extremely durable, particularly against impact forces and extreme cold, all of this even without using their adaptive powers. They were also extremely agile for their size, and were capable of flying faster than the 1973 versions. Their adaptive powers worked by using mutant powers to adapt to the obstacle or threat they were facing, althrough they seemed unable to copy the powers of certain mutants. Among the powers they were able to copy were those of Colossus, Iceman, Sunspot, Rockslide and Emma Frost. They were also capable of transforming their faces into powerful laser cannons, whose energy output was so high that 3 Sentinels were capable of overloading Bishop's energy absorbing powers in seconds, causing him to explode. They could also shapeshift their arms into various weapons and tools, including pikes and drills.

After Sophie's untimely death, they began calling themselves the Four-In-One. The Cuckoos blamed Emma Frost for Sophie's death, and separated themselves from her. This hurt her greatly. The Stepford Cuckoos then telepathically communicated with <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> while at a gathering, not only to test the new limits on their reduced powers, but also to tell her about Emma's telepathic affair with <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Scott.</a> Jean furiously confronted Emma and trampled through Emma's mind, humiliating her. Emma managed to barely hold out against this attack in her diamond form until Scott willingly showed Jean that nothing had happened. Emma was later discovered in her diamond form, shattered in pieces, having been shot by a diamond bullet while in her diamond body, which had one flaw. To help find the murderer, Sage and Bishop came to investigate. They found that Angel Salvador killed Emma, but was being mind-controlled by Esme, who was working for Xorn (Magneto). Deciding to flee, Esme told the other Cuckoos that she desired individuality and that Emma Frost did not care about them, but instead only wanted to make them like her. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was leaving.

The Phoenix Force revived Sophie, who took one look at Quentin as he professed his love to her, and responded, \"Eww.\" Sophie then reverted to a corpse again, preferring death to being with Quentin. The other Cuckoos assisted the X-Men as they fought the Phoenix Force by using Cerebra to contact all of the X-Men and collecting them to channel positive thoughts and love to Jean Grey. Jean Grey was then able to wrest control from the Phoenix Force and spiritually move onward to the White Hot Room, dying again. Quentin realized that Sophie would never love him and returned to a deep sleep. Meanwhile, a shard of the Phoenix communicated with one of the Cuckoos, who responded \"Oh, of course.

The three Cuckoos each handled the Phoenix's influence differently. Celeste feared the power of the Phoenix, remembering how it drove Jean Grey insane, while Phoebe embraced its destructive powers. They went to different staff separately to try to work out their feelings and their growing identities, free of their sisters. However, before the X-Men could effectively intervene, the Phoenix took over and the Cuckoos returned to <a href=\"/the-world/4020-41078/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41078\">The World</a>, the headquarters of the Weapons Plus program. Meanwhile, Esme and Sophie mysteriously revived, albeit in decaying forms, and spoke of collecting information and realizing their true mission.</p><p>The X-Men followed the Cuckoos and learned that as creations of The World, the Cuckoos have implanted nano-technology that caused them to unknowingly transmit any and all information they encountered back to The World. Thus, Esme and Sophie did not actually return to life, but were rather piloted by their nano-technological systems. In addition, Emma learnt that the Cuckoos were truly her daughters, having been cloned from her eggs, which were harvested by <a href=\"/sublime/4005-11330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11330\">Dr. Sublime</a> while she was in a coma following a Sentinel attack years before. Sublime cloned a thousand Cuckoos, in tanks hooked up to machinery. The original five were released to infiltrate the school and transmit information. Their origins were never questioned due to a strong telepathic block placed in everyone's minds which would cause their thoughts to redirect whenever they questioned where the Cuckoos came from.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-134071\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.48\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-134071\"><img alt=\"Weapon XIV\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Weapon XIV\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Weapon XIV</figcaption></figure><p>Dr. Sublime intended the remaining Cuckoos to return and join their \"sisters\". The true purpose of the Thousand-In-One (called Weapon XIV) was to combine their minds into one immense psychic weapon and telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. By assimilating the original Cuckoos into the one, Sublime would be able to control the power of the Phoenix through his control of the Thousand-In-One. It was then revealed that every Cuckoo could also turn into a diamond form, but unlike Emma, their diamond forms were flawless. He could then use the Thousand to split the Phoenix between all of them and trap it within their diamond bodies, thus giving him further control. Mindee willingly chose to re-assimilate, but Phoebe attempted to fight her way out. The X-Men attempted to destroy Sublime. When the X-Men severed Sublime's control of the Thousand and deactivated all the Cuckoos' nano-technology (including the original three), each individual clone awoke with their own consciousness and reached out to their sisters and mother.</p><p>It was revealed that Celeste was chosen as the primary host for the Phoenix because it heard Celeste \"call\" to her, as Celeste longed to feel, to live, and to burn with life. Emma reached out to a fearful Celeste and told her that her methods of teaching - trying to make the girls cold and emotionless as a means of protecting them - was flawed and that she hoped the girls would live with passion. She then gave Celeste the confidence to do \"what was right\" with the Phoenix Force and for her sisters.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249689\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249689\"><img alt=\"Three-in-one\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Three-in-one\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Three-in-one</figcaption></figure><p>However, to Emma's horror, the Phoenix used Celeste to destroy every \"sister\" of the Weapon XIV and the revived Sophie and Esme in order to end their threat against mutant-kind. The only ones spared were Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe. During the aftermath, Celeste begged the Phoenix to leave her as what it had forced her to do was too much. The Phoenix decided it wanted to stay with Celeste, so to stop it, Celeste divided her into three, and each remaining Cuckoo turned her heart into flawless organic diamond. Doing so trapped the Phoenix within them so that it could no longer wreak havoc. Unfortunately, this also caused the Cuckoos to lose their emotions forever. Thus, the Cuckoos - especially Celeste, who longed to truly live, grow, and love - sacrificed their ability to ever do so for the sake of maintaining peace. In truth, the Phoenix they encountered was merely a shard of the true Phoenix, having been shattered into billions of pieces at the end of <i>X-Men: Phoenix Endsong</i>. Despite this, that shard remained divided in three and sealed within Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe.</p><p>These events devastated Emma, whose thousands of cloned daughters had each just begun to reach out for her with their minds when the Phoenix chose to destroy them. Emma then vowed that the Phoenix would have to contend with her if it ever returned, be it cosmic entity or in the form of Jean Grey.</p><h3>Quest for Magik</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b> <a href=\"/quest-for-magik/4045-47186/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47186\">Quest for Magik</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303941\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.3125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:31.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303941\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Cuckoos helped Elixir to master biological manipulation by taking all biological and medical information from <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast's</a> head and duplicating it in <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir's</a> mind.

When the Skrulls created a psychic blockade, it rendered every telepath useless and attempting to use their powers hurt them psychically. They soon channeled their powers to Emma Frost with the help of Cerebra, in the hopes that Frost would find and destroy the psychic blockade. Emma's psyche was temporarily disconnected from her body as she fought off the psychic Skrulls. The Cuckoos followed Cyclops' orders and used their telepathy to keep Emma's autonomic functions going, thereby animating her empty body. Emma finally destroyed the blockade, allowing the girls to use their telepathy again.</p><h3>Nation X</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b>: <a href=\"/nation-x/4045-55961/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55961\">Nation X</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1039279\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.39181286549708\" data-width=\"1197\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1197px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:39.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1039279\"><img alt=\"The Phoenix Fragments Leaving\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 1197w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Phoenix Fragments Leaving\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 1197w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36633/1039279-cuckoos_517.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Phoenix Fragments Leaving</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=\"/scalphunter/4005-9734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9734\">Scalphunter</a> sent a group of <a href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\">Predator X</a> to <a href=\"/utopia/4020-56536/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56536\">Utopia</a>, the X-Men were forced to battle the mutant-eating creatures.

It mysteriously returned to space, leaving the girls unconscious.</p><p>Once the Stepford Cuckoos woke up from their coma, they began scanning for the Phoenix. Since they couldn't find any trace of the psychic entity, they asked <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> to take some of their power so they could try passive scanning, as Mindee believed that the Phoenix could bend active psychic probes the same way a black hole does with light. They explained to Rogue that she wouldn't just get the power, she'd get the perspective as well, the perspective of triangulating on people's minds. When Rogue finished with the Cuckoos' powers, they said that the silence of little or no telepathy could be deafening. They also told Scott that they didn't find anything on Cerebra. He then asked her if they had gotten a trace of the Phoenix when it left them, and they replied that it got further and further away without actually moving.</p><h3>Avengers vs X-Men</h3><p>The Cuckoos were relocated from <a href=\"/utopia/4020-41752/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\">Utopia</a> after the Phoenix-crazed Scott and Emma began acting out.

They traveled with Emma Frost, Cyclops, Magik, Iceman, and Goldballs to Muir Island to investigate a distress call they received. They discovered the bodies of Multiple Man, writhing in agony before dying. Emma and Cyclops proceeded into the facility, where Cyclops was soon poisoned by the mist. Though he had died, Emma projected an image of Cyclops to honor his legacy. The Cuckoos were able to see this, but Emma threatened them, forcing them to keep quiet about his death. Together, Emma and the Cuckoos projected an image of Cyclops to everyone on the entire planet, delivering a speech to inform the world about the toxicity of the Terrigen Mist. The Cuckoos helped Emma destroy half of the Terrigen Mists roaming the world. After a brief conflict with the Inhuman royal family, Cyclops appeared to have been killed by Black Bolt. This was just the projection, as Cyclops had already died from the mist, but no one knew that except the Cuckoos. A truce was negotiated, and Emma agreed to give the Inhumans some time to work things out their way.</p><h3>Inhumans vs X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078286\" data-ratio=\"0.60180995475113\" data-width=\"884\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 884px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078286\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 884w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 884w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The conflict between the Inhumans and the X-Men escalated when Beast discovered that the mutants had approximately one week left to live. Emma returned to the fold with the Cuckoos, and prepared for war. The Cuckoos helped Emma throughout the conflict, and especially in the final battle when they hijacked the minds of several Inhumans, turning them against their own people. They continued to fight alongside Emma, until the climax of the battle, when Emma was revealed to have engineered the entire conflict to avenge Cyclops. It was also revealed that Black Bolt had not actually killed Cyclops, but only the projection of him created by Emma, as the Cuckoos already knew. After the conflict had subsided, Emma had gone into hiding, and the focus of the Cuckoos returned to their education. They enrolled in the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, headed by Kitty Pryde and located in Central Park.</p><h2>Powers</h2><h3>Telepathic Gestalt</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-747873\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.98681055155875\" data-width=\"834\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 834px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-747873\"><img alt=\"Psychic Gestalt\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg 834w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Psychic Gestalt\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg 834w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Psychic Gestalt</figcaption></figure><p>The Stepford Cuckoos are powerful telepaths, who can combine their telepathic abilities to create an even more powerful hive-mind. Their telepathic powers include broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, blasts of pure psionic energy, seeing through another person's eyes, and also are so powerful that they are one of the few people able to operate Cerebra. The Stepford Cuckoos are considered to be near Omega-level mutants, though they have never been classified as such, and since the deaths of their two sisters, have reduced in power.</p><h3>Hive Intelligence</h3><p>The Cuckoos shared mental link also bolstered their collective intelligence. This allows the Cuckoos telepathic not only to multiply by an incredibly high factor through their shared mindscape. But it also massively accelerated their brain power and analytical processing speed. Accumulatively making their intellectual prowess even greater than the sum total of each of the girls individual parts. Likewise it is unknown how powerful they're combined genius is with the main two of their psychic mind; Sophie and Esme.</p><h3>Diamond Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/207232-189849-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207232\" data-ratio=\"0.39\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:39.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/207232-189849-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207232\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/207232-189849-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/207232-189849-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/207232-189849-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/207232-189849-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Cuckoos have also inherited the ability to turn into organic diamond like their mother, Emma Frost. However, unlike Emma, their diamond forms are flawless and cannot be shattered. All three can either turn an internal organ into perfect diamond while staying organic on the outside like they did with their hearts to imprison and capture the errant Phoenix shard during events of <em>Warsong </em>or fully become diamond to protect themselves during an ambush by demons in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/limbo-hell/4020-42990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo</a>.

To do this they had to become become organic again, sharing the same restrictions Emma has in her Diamond form.</p><p>Alternate versions of the Cuckoos have also demonstrated the power of precognition. This may or may not be true for the Earth-616 Cuckoos.</p><h2>Former Powers</h2><h3>Phoenix Force</h3><p>In <i>X-Men: Phoenix Warsong</i>, they were the avatars of the Phoenix. During possession, they displayed new powers related to the Phoenix, such as Phoenix-granted telekinesis and fire generation. It is unlikely that they still possess these abilities, however, especially after their captured Phoenix fragments left them abruptly during the <i>Nation X</i> storyline. It should be noted that avatars of the Phoenix are normally only Omega-level mutants and that the Phoenix in question was merely a shard of the full Phoenix Force. Regardless of this, they are uniquely powerful telepaths and essential to the X-Men. Often, they maintain telepathic communication for the teams via Cerebra when Emma is occupied with other missions.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-15104</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216381\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0448275862069\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216381\"><img alt=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here Comes Tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>The Stepford Cuckoos also exist on Earth-15104, known as <a href=\"/here-comes-tomorrow/4045-41708/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41708\">Here Comes Tomorrow</a>.

Sensing that the crazed Phoenix will burn away their minds, they initiate a self-destruct sequence, committing suicide.</p><h3>Earth-58163</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1100246\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5126262626263\" data-width=\"396\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 396px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1100246\"><img alt=\"House of M\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 396w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"House of M\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 396w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>House of M</figcaption></figure><p>On Earth-58163, <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>, all five Cuckoos were alive and well. Sophie still seemed to be the more dominant Cuckoo and still had the urge to be a heroine. When she found out that David and Nori were going to Japan to find Nori's father (who was labeled as a human terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D, who were also looking for him, but to put an end to him), Sophie decided that she wanted to help them and left her sisters to go to Japan.</p><p>Sophie proved to be quite an asset to the team that went to Japan (which included Prodigy, Surge, Jubilee, Dust, Wallflower and Mercury). Even though most of the human terrorists were shielded from psionic attacks, Sophie still had enough power to manipulate some of their thoughts, and make them do as she commanded. She also helped the New Mutants in a premature face-off with the Hellions, and when Quill attacked Prodigy, she commanded Quill to surrender to her, which he did. She also was able to scan minds, which was how she learned that Wallflower was really working with the people of an experiment known as 'Project Genesis' which was what the New Mutants and the human terrorists wanted to shut down.</p><p>Wallflower quickly used her pheromones to make all the parties involved (New Mutants, Hellions and the human terrorists) hate each other so much that they would fight to the death. This brawl was ended by Mercury, who was immune to Wallflower's pheromone manipulation, when she killed Wallflower. Wind Dancer of the Hellions, cleared the pheromones in the air with her wind-manipulating powers, and Sophie, knowing that the pheromones only fueled hatred that was already there, started to use her psionics to strip the hatred so there would be no more fighting. Tragically, Sophie was gunned down by a human terrorist who was immune to her psionic manipulation, as she was trying to make peace, but the gunman refused to be at peace with mutant-kind and wanted to fight them.</p><h3>Earth-91172</h3><p>On Earth-91172, a world ravaged by the Hulk, three of the Cuckoos are alive. Mindee and Esme are the Two-in-One and Sophie has broken away and developed precognitive abilities. They are members of the Next Wave of Heroes - the last heroes of Earth led by Quentin Quire. Other members are Patriot, Wiccan, Lightspeed and Speedball. Sophie dreams of a team of dimension-hopping heroes who can help them (the Exiles), which leads to Quentin trying to reach them and create a new team, the New Exiles. In this reality, Quentin and Sophie are a couple.</p><h3>X-Men: The End</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-187948\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58921161825726\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-187948\"><img alt=\"X-Men: The End\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 241w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men: The End\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men: The End</figcaption></figure><p>In X-Men: The End, a possible alternate future, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe, call themselves the Spikes.

      "description": "<h2><b>Origin</b></h2><h3>Queen</h3><p>The Brood's civilization is based on insect societies such as the bees or ants consisting of a Hive-like lair. All Brood civilizations share strong telepathic bonds with their <a href=\"/brood-queen/4005-14746/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14746\">Queens</a>, thus predicting no rebellions occurring against the Queens. The Broodlings do all the work and have an undying allegiance to their Queen, however each Queen do not share in a common interest.</p><h3>Subspecies</h3><p>There are a few different types of Brood. Starting with the Broodlings who are brown in color and have known to have transparent wings. Next up is the Queen, which is also brown in colour and have no wings. They give out the orders to the Broodlings to fulfill. The second last are referred to as \"the Pure-Borns\", they are the firstborn offspring which have had no exposure to other races, they are green in color and rather large.</p><p>Lastly, the <a href=\"/brood-empress/4005-42767/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42767\">Empress Brood</a> which is also green in colour and extremely large, they are the supreme rulers of the Brood. Recently <a href=\"/phyla/4005-40922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40922\">Phyla-Vell</a> (the new Quasar) and <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> encountered and fought a newly discovered strain of the Brood species above the planet Dlaw-Neurg during the events of <a href=\"/annihilation-conquest/4045-44982/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-44982\">Annihilation: Conquest</a>. Unlike its brethren the Brood had no eyes, a brown-colored heavily armored exoskeleton and silver-colored wings.</p><p>The Brood also possessed the ability to breath in space and was at the very least three times the size of a full-grown Brood Empress. The creature, as far as anyone can tell, was little more than a feral beast and was not raised in a Hive-mind culture like its cousins. Moondragon later deducted that the Brood (along with a sand-dwelling member of a previously undiscovered gargantuan insectoid species) were the guardians of a deserted palace <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a> once lived in sitting in the sand dunes of Dlaw-Neurg and therefore were not actually natives of Dlaw-Neurg leaving the Brood's true origins open to speculation.</p><p>Recently, an unknown alien adversary of Kitty Pryde secretly infected her with an airborne virus that impregnated her with a microscopic Brood egg-sac, which made her body grow into that of a pregnant woman in her ninth month within a span of a few hours. It should be noted that these micro-Brood have been engineered to grow by consuming every last cell of their host from the inside-out and therefore must be removed before the Brood have a chance to grow out of control.</p><h3>Evolution</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2996556\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1913043478261\" data-width=\"460\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2996556\"><img alt=\"Original form of the Brood\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" data-width=\"537\"></a><figcaption>Original form of the Brood</figcaption></figure><p>Originally, the Brood had a much softer, docile form. Having traveled to the past, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> came across one in a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> research facility. Rescuing the creature from his confinement, it attacked Wolverine by trying to put a Brood embryo inside him. Wolverine countered by stabbing himself in the abdomen where the embryo was. The embryo died and the creature tried to attack him physically. Wolverine slew it with his adamantium claws. Coming across a monitor, Wolverine saw that the creature was part of a hive which adapted itself according to the damage the creature had sustained. It developed an exoskeleton and expanded its teeth and jaws. Wolverine realized he was reponsible for the evolution of the Brood into the savage creatures they were today.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Brood was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a>, <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/4040-4447/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4447\">Dave Cockrum</a> and <a href=\"/bob-wiacek/4040-3271/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3271\">Bob Wiacek</a> in 1982 and first appeared in <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/4050-3092/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3092\">Uncanny X-Men</a> # 155.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Brood Saga</h3><p><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> and the X-Men are on a <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a> spaceship led by <a href=\"/lord-samedar/4005-21758/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21758\">Lord Samedar</a> and <a href=\"/araki/4005-11318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11318\">Araki</a>.

When a group of bystanders go to the crash site a sleizoids attack and kills most of them before it steals the identity of the last survivor. The man was a parametric, so the Brood uses this to infect dying mutants that he comes across during his job, therfore building a army of Brood that posses super powers.</p><p>The X-Men sense their presence and go looking for them. They find the man who was originally infected but he fight off the X-Men. He leads them to a ally where they're attacked by a large group of Brood.

A smaller experiment was later developed by Department K with a New Zealand terrorist, who would become the third individual to be known as Weapon X, merging him with a symbiotic bacteria colony.</p><h3>New Weapon X</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/79465-81749-the-director.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79465\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.07\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/79465-81749-the-director.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79465\"><img alt=\"The Director\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/79465-81749-the-director.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/79465-81749-the-director.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Director\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/79465-81749-the-director.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/79465-81749-the-director.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Director</figcaption></figure><p>Director <a href=\"/the-director/4005-15621/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15621\">Malcolm Colcord</a> forms the third version of the Weapon X Project, designed to monitor and eliminate mutants. <a href=\"/the-director/4005-15621/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15621\">Colcord</a>, once a security guard at the first Weapon X project, suffered severe facial lacerations during an escape attempt by the mutant Wolverine. Unlike the previous two installments of Weapon X, the third Project was completely U.S.-based and focused not only on the creation of living weapons, but also on the ultimate goal of Colcord, the creation of death camps. The Director initially uses Weapon X as his personal strike force to exact revenge against Wolverine. He soon begins utilizing its resources for the capturing and imprisonment of mutants in the secret government death camp called <a href=\"/neverland/4020-55994/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55994\">Neverland</a>. Mutants who are not suitable to be used as military weapons would be executed, while those that are suitable are given the choice to join Weapon X or die.</p><p>A number of mutants, such as <a href=\"/cecilia-reyes/4005-14177/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14177\">Cecilia Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/maggott/4005-15072/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15072\">Maggott</a>, <a href=\"/ape/4005-13368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13368\">Ape</a>, <a href=\"/tar-baby/4005-14553/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14553\">Tarbaby</a>, <a href=\"/leech/4005-3193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3193\">Leech</a> and many others were arrested by Weapon X's agents and sent to Neverland. Those mutants deemed useless to the project were killed in gas chambers, while others were brainwashed to become Weapon X operatives. The organs of the executed prisoners were then sent to the <a href=\"/u-men/4060-47994/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47994\">U-Men</a>. The agents of the third Weapon X were <a href=\"/agent-brent-jackson/4005-15622/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15622\">Agent Brent Jackson</a> a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent; Sabretooth, who was given new adamantium implants; the shapeshifter <a href=\"/copycat/4005-13311/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13311\">Copycat</a>, Deadpool, and <a href=\"/mauvais/4005-15624/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15624\">Mauvais</a>.</p><p>Later on, Deadpool went rogue and new operatives were recruited into Weapon X, many of whom had their powers enhanced or were brainwashed into servitude. Maverick was saved from certain death and his powers were enhanced with the purpose of assassinating Wolverine, thus Agent Zero was created. Former member of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a> <a href=\"/wild-child/4005-9476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9476\">Wildchild</a> was brainwashed and further mutated into a Nosferatu-like feral humanoid. Former mutant terrorist Marrow had her powers set to a controllable level, restoring the young woman's natural beauty. <a href=\"/sauron/4005-3180/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3180\">Sauron</a>'s personality was merged with that of his Karl Lykos self and his energy-draining powers enhanced so he could fire energy blasts. Garrison Kane was further transformed into a cybernetic being.</p><p>Aurora was kidnapped and brainwashed, like <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/4005-24399/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24399\">Madison Jeffries</a>, who was extracted from the terrorist group known as the Zodiac and used to create hundreds of Boxbots loyal to Weapon X to serve as guards at Neverland. Washout had his powers enhanced, though at a heavy cost. Each usage of his powers endangered his life and eventually, he dies trying to kill Colcord. <a href=\"/mesmero/4005-5065/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5065\">Mesmero</a> joins willingly, while <a href=\"/reaper/4005-10317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10317\">Reaper</a> and <a href=\"/wildside/4005-14842/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14842\">Wildside</a>, former members of the Mutant Liberation Front, became agents of the program in exchange for their lives. The psychic mutant Jack-in-the-Box joins after his legs and arms were amputated. He becomes a living polygraph.</p><p>Unbeknown to all, except Sabretooth, Mister Sinister was disguised as the head scientist at the Neverland facility, Doctor Robert Windsor. As Windsor, Sinister supposedly helped some mutants escape from Neverland, but he was only taking them to his own secret labs. After some time, Brent Jackson, the only human officially on the team, took over as Director, during a mutiny by the team in conjunction with an attack by mutants from the Underground. Cable led this group, in a mission to destroy Weapon X and expose its existence and its human rights violations. Washout and Garrison Kane died in the event, while Sabretooth was washed away into the sewers after a battle with Marrow.</p><p>Marrow used the battle to escape from Weapon X, eventually taking over the Mutant Underground, now reformed as the third incarnation of Gene Nation. Colcord fled Weapon X, with the always loyal Jeffries, and Aurora as well. Director Brent Jackson's team consisted of Wildchild, Sauron, Agent Zero, Mesmero, Jack-in-the-Box, and newly recruited Chamber, whose face was restored by the program's scientists.</p><p>Chamber was originally a double agent working for the X-Men, but was subsequently brainwashed into Jackson's service. Mister Sinister, under the alias of Dr. Windsor, remains at Weapon X. At some point, Jackson's team fought with Colcord's Boxbots. Colcord regains control of Weapon X. A person claiming to be Chamber has joined a superhero team known as Excelsior, but that person turned out to be an impostor. Following M-Day, both Chamber and Mesmero are rendered powerless.</p><p>Neverland is shut down and the prisoners, either powered or depowered, are executed by hosts of Boxbots. Records of the massive executions are discovered by Beast in the Endangered Species storyline, which also hints that some of the bodies of the prisoners executed prior to M-Day were sent to Ord and used in the research to develop the cure for mutation.</p><h3>Weapons of Mutant Destruction</h3><p>Under the direction of Reverend <a href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a>, a new Weapon X program emerged, which focused on the creation of undetectable killer cyborgs that could eventually eradicate mutantkind. These cyborgs were created from regular humans Stryker lured into his cause. As part of the process to refine their cyborgs, Weapon X targeted several mutants with special abilities of their interest, namely Logan, Sabretooth, <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"/domino/4005-2161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2161\">Domino</a> and <a href=\"/lady-deathstrike/4005-8470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8470\">Lady Deathstrike</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>Logan uses the name Weapon X instead of Wolverine. Additionally, Deadpool didn't receive his healing factor from Weapon X, but from Apocalypse.</p>",

By 1987, Rob wanted to pitch Youngblood to some new independent comic book publishers and landed a job at <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/megaton-comics/4010-2286/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2286\">Megaton Comics</a> where Youngblood was first published <strong>before</strong> they made their way to <a href=\"/image/4010-513/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-513\">Image Comics</a> in 1992. Rob was a fan of <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel</a>'s <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a>' <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\">Teen Titans</a> (the Wolfman/Perez era) and the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Superheroes</a>, and based on those interests he combined them to form Youngblood (not to be confused with <a href=\"/project-youngblood/4060-61776/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61776\">Project: Youngblood</a> from <a href=\"/eclipse/4010-285/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-285\">Eclipse Comics</a>).

Labs</a> android and an unknown character. That proposal was rejected. At that same year Liefeld left Marvel over their strain relationship and merchandising rights for the success from his tenure on <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a>. When he became one of the founders of Image and with his imprint studio, Extreme Studios, Liefeld revived his early Youngblood team and integrated it with his Teen Titans proposal to create new characters to expand the team roaster: Shaft, Badrock, Die Hard, Chapel, Vogue, and Combat.</p><p>Liefeld's idea for Youngblood as celebrity superheroes:</p><blockquote><p>\"...if superheroes really did exist, they would be treated much the same way as movie stars and athletes. The series, therefore, depicts the superhero members of Youngblood not only as they participate in adventures fighting crime and evil, but navigating the world of celebrity endorse deals, TV show appearances, agents, managers, and the perceived pressures of celebrity life. They live in a world where they are the big celebrities with big paychecks and business managers. In the Youngblood world, the world powers race is not nuclear but genetic engineering...who can create bigger, better super-men.\"</p></blockquote><p> With a large team of superheroes on Youngblood, Liefeld came up with a solution of splitting the team into two fractions: the new characters became the home front team for domestic problems and the original team became the overseas \"away\" team for international crisis.</p><p> Since Youngblood's debut as the first comic book published by Image Comics on April 17th 1992, it has gained a controversial legacy over the years for bad artwork, dialogue, storytelling, and later creative disputes from different high-profile comic book writers like <a href=\"/kurt-busiek/4040-41741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek</a> and <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a>.</p><p> As of August 1st 2019, Rob Liefeld announced on his Facebook page that he wants nothing to do with Youngblood over a tricky exchange of rights to the characters when Liefeld left Image to form <a href=\"/awesome-comics/4010-1870/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1870\">Awesome Entertainment</a> in 1997. Details include selling Youngblood for movie deals that never manifested and toy deals to a third party - Scott Rosenburg - who then sold the Youngblood property to Andrew Rev, &amp; Terrific Production LLC. Image Comics will no longer publish Youngblood or any involvement. On April 17th 2020, Rob Liefeld announced that he is currently developing a \"replacement for Youngblood\" in the form of a new creation called \"<strong>EKO 92</strong>\".</p><h2>History</h2><p> Youngblood is a team of government sanction superheroes created by Director <a href=\"/graves/4005-5241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5241\">Alexander Graves</a> on behalf of the US government after the existence of <a href=\"/operation-knightstrike/4060-55433/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55433\">Operation: Knightstrike</a>, a top secret task force, was broadcast on network television. In 1984, our heads of state decided that they needed a powerful public force; a force that could represent the government to the people.

Sentinel was imprisoned at Supreme's Citadel in the Hell of Mirrors for the murder of Riptide. Knightsabre went back to Australia in disgust at how quickly his former teammates had been willing to assume his guilt.

His one proviso is that space be found in the group for his adopted son, Leonard, who always wanted to be a superhero. Although more than slightly dubious about that last part, Shaft felt he can't look a gift horse in the mouth, and accepted his offer. Shaft manage to only recruit Twilight, Johnny Panic, Doc Rocket, and Suprema.</p><p> Shaft's new Youngblood team had some short lived adventures that included a confrontation with <a href=\"/stormhead/4005-72971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72971\">Stormhead</a>, the Occupant, Sentinel and his evil Youngblood team <a href=\"/badblood/4060-63550/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-63550\">Badblood</a>, and <a href=\"/jack-a-dandy/4005-61964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61964\">Jack-A-Dandy</a> and his <a href=\"/jackettes/4060-63812/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-63812\">Jackettes</a>.</p><h4>2003 Lineup (Arcade Comics):</h4><p> Long since the government-sponsored super-team Youngblood dissembled due to the increasing number of super-powered individuals.

His curiosity led him to investigate this unknown philanthropist, only to discover himself to be a pawn of <a href=\"/general-immortus/4005-25155/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25155\">General Immortus</a>, a criminal mastermind striving to recreate an immortality elixir that had kept him alive for centuries. To guarantee Caulder's loyalty, Immortus had a bomb inserted in the scientist's chest which only Immortus could safely remove while Caulder lived. Caulder, however, tricked the General into shooting him, then, having reprogrammed his robot assistant, he had the mechanical surgeon operate to remove the bomb after he was clinically \"dead.\" The operation was only a partial success. Niles Caulder lived, but lost the use of his legs, becoming confined to a wheelchair. Destroying his lab and all his notes to prevent Immortus from discovering the secret he sought, Caulder seemingly vanished, and even the ancient overlord of crime could not find him.</p><p>Only after Niles Caulder's death would Immortus learn that, during his researches, the scientist had served as a Red Cross volunteer in India, where he met and later married a young woman named Arani, who became the first and only beneficiary of the Immortality serum. After going into hiding to escape Immortus, Caulder never returned to his new bride, fearing reprisals from his enemy. He surfaced only twice more before settling permanently in the brownstone combination laboratory/living quarters in Midway City that was to become the headquarters of the Doom Patrol.</p><p>First, he created a special radiation-proof fabric which was used to allow Larry Trainor, <a href=\"/negative-man/4005-4087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4087\">Negative Man</a>, to walk the streets after he became permanently radioactive.

After their marriage, Rita continued her association with the Doom Patrol despite Dayton's open antagonism towards them. Together, Steve and Rita adopted orphan Garfield Logan, the teen-age hero called Beast Boy (who would eventually become the New Titan known as Changeling).</p><p>After a series of adventures, the four original members were trapped on their island base by <a href=\"/madame-rouge/4005-33038/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33038\">Madame Rouge</a> and her ally, <a href=\"/captain-zahl/4005-33039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33039\">Captain Zahl</a>, and given an ultimatum: either they would allow ZahI to blow up the island and destroy them, or he would detonate another bomb which would wipe out a fishing village of fourteen inhabitants. Heroes to the end, the Doom Patrol voted to sacrifice themselves, and Zahl triggered his explosive, seemingly killing the entire quartet.</p><p>Two other regular characters in Doom Patrol, one who became a part-time member of the team and the other a non-member ally, lived on after the destruction of the original group. Beast Boy, later known as the Changeling, became a member of both <a href=\"/teen-titans-west/4060-41546/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41546\">Titans West</a> and the New Teen Titans. Meanwhile, Steve Dayton continued to perfect his Mento helmet; Dayton vowed vengeance and spent much time and money in search of his wife's killers only to be captured by them. Several months after Dayton's disappearance, Gar Logan, now Changeling, asked Robotman to help him find Mento.

The team followed them into the painting but lost to the Brotherhood.

That’s because the street is a genderqueer sentient street that teleports around the world attracting outsiders that need a home.

Flex knew it was the real Men from NOWHERE, but he couldn’t remember the details. He couldn’t even remember how he escaped, just that in his confusion, he found himself on Danny the Street. Mr. Jones was just a rogue agent, but his failure turned the real Men from NOWHERE’s attention to Danny, kidnapping Flex and Dorothy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With Danny’s teleportation, the Doom Patrol was able to break into the Pentagon, which was actually a pentagram, created to hold in dead spirits for a being known as the Telephone Avatar to feed on. While the Doom Patrol fought off operatives, Flex Mentallo was able to tap into his powers and briefly reshape the Pentagon as a circle, weakening the Avatar.

When Cliff finally got his act together, he found Josh dead by Chief’s hands, who no longer needed his wheelchair and hadn’t for some time. Sadly, Cliff couldn’t do anything about it due to a failsafe Chief built into his robot body. With a captive audience, Chief admitted to being the mastermind behind Cliff and his original teammates' accidents.

Cliff is outmatched so he retreats and asks Danny to bring him to <a href=\"/will-magnus/4005-9536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9536\">Will Magnus</a>, who he then brings to Chief's lab.

Foxfur had assembled his Old Foxes, a group of elderly grumps, to fight back against Crowdark and her Wild Girls, a band of feral children wreaking havoc. Both spirits took an interest in members of the Doom Patrol. Crowdark saw Dorothy as her chosen champion, while Foxfur saw Cliff as his. When Dorothy and Cliff refused to fight each other, Foxfur and Crowdark bury the hatchet and end their war.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Later, the Pentagon came calling yet again, this time for The Bandage People. They had previously been members of The Builders, spirits who were building a modern Tower of Babel for the Pentagon.

Once he was back, he started remembering what happened. He and Coagula were going to introduce Dorothy to her real mom.

The real Robotman decides to stick with the team, as does Beast Boy from Jost’s other team.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After the death of their resident engineer, Zviad, Robotman walked away from the team, allowing Jost to force the rest of the team to disband.

The final member to join this team was <a href=\"/owen-mercer/4005-7650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7650\">Boomerang</a> in <a href=\"/the-outsiders-37-reign-of-doomsday-part-two-dooms-/4000-265488/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-265488\">The Outsiders #37</a> (April 2011).</p><h3>Outsiders Vol. 4</h3><p>After Arsenal and Nightwing left the team, Batman rebuilt the team through a lengthy audition process. He needed a team to help him deal with <a href=\"/brother-eye/4005-51483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51483\">Brother Eye</a>, his rogue A.I.. The team eventually consisted of Outsiders regulars: Metamorpho, Katana, and Grace, plus newcomers Martian Manhunter and Catwoman. In addition, Batman had scientists Dr. Francine Langstrom and Dr. Salah Miandad on staff to research OMAC technology. Although, she was kicked off the team by Batman, Thunder's close relationship to Grace made her a regular ally with the team. Eventually, Batgirl and Green Arrow were recruited, and Geo-Force was transferred from the JLA back to the Outsiders.</p><p>After the death of Batman, the team had a major overhaul. Alfred ran one of Batman's contingency plans to build a team of Outsiders to work as Batman outside of Gotham, with each member representing a part of Batman. Geo-Force is his bravery and leadership. Black Lightning is his morality, and Katana is his sense of justice. The new Owlman has Batman's detective abilities, and The Creeper has his fear factor. Halo is the surrogate Robin, symbol of innocence, and Metamorpho is an all-purpose \"utility belt.\"</p><h3>Rebirth</h3><p>After reality is warped a few times, The Outsiders become a team with a secret history that Batman had been hiding from the world. He eventually goes semi-public with the team when he discloses his plan for a new team to the Justice League. He puts some of his youngest allies: Signal, Orphan, and Batgirl (Barbara) under the tutelage of Black Lightning and Katana, eventually trusting the two of them to run the team without him.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Without Batman</h3><p>Batman withholds the knowledge that Bedlam has been brought to life and retook <a href=\"/markovia/4020-55845/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55845\">Markovia</a> with help from the <a href=\"/masters-of-disaster/4060-31531/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31531\">Masters of Disaster</a> and other Soviet forces. This angers the team and leads Batman to disband the group. However, the team minus Batman travels to Markovia where they discover dead soldiers because of Bedlam. After beating Bedlam, they discover he has cloned <a href=\"/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9671\">Adolf Hitler,</a> but the clone soon kills himself because of the horrors caused by his older self. The team is soon branded as Markovian agents who gain funding from the country and they soon move to <a href=\"/los-angeles/4020-56019/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56019\">L.A.</a> in a new headquarters, but Geo-Force leaves. Geo-Force has divorced his wife Denise Howard and Looker and her husband are now separated. Batman only leaves for 1 year.</p><h3>Los Angeles</h3><p>The group also battles their foes the Forces of July again and the team battles the <a href=\"/duke-of-oil/4005-4450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4450\">Duke of Oil</a> and the <a href=\"/peoples-heroes/4060-47050/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47050\">People’s Heroes</a>, a group of Soviet super villains. The team was also stranded on an island for three weeks, Geo-Force and Looker had an affair and he gives up his position as team leader on the island but the team is soon rescued. The Looker is soon followed by a detective who learns of her real identity and tries to blackmail her. However, she hypnotizes him and forces him to leave her alone, but he was soon killed. Looker is arrested for the crime and the team is unable to clear her name of the charges.</p><h3>Return of Batman</h3><p>The team rejoins with Batman to battle <a href=\"/eclipso/4005-3763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3763\">Eclipso</a> and are given access to the L.A. Batcave. Geo-Force and Looker break off their affair after feelings of guilt, the cave is infiltrated by a clone of Windfall, but was killed during a battle with the Masters of Disaster and the real Windfall leaves her team and joins the Outsiders.</p><h3>Millennium</h3><p>The team would soon face hardship as Dr. Jace was revealed to be working with the <a href=\"/the-manhunters/4060-55857/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55857\">Manhunters</a>. The team is taken prisoner but escape with help from <a href=\"/atomic-knight/4005-30925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30925\">Atomic Knight</a> who joins the team. Dr. Jace dies when she was blown up along with Metamorpho. Looker also looses her powers after returning to the Abyssia when her powers came from and battled the Manhunters. Halo is also wounded saving Katana and falls in a coma and is watched by Katana. After these events Geo-Force has the team break up once again.</p><h3>Volume Two</h3><p>Markovia is taken over by a vampire-lord who has Geo-Force branded a traitor. Geo-Force is forced to reform the Outsiders with new and old members to battle the threat. Looker is killed during the battle. The team is blamed for the destruction of a Markovian village, sending them into hiding. <a href=\"/atomic-knight/4005-30925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30925\">Atomic Knight</a> soon rejoins the team after tracking down the team to bring them in, but is proved of their innocence. <a href=\"/faust/4005-11292/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11292\">Faust</a>, <a href=\"/technocrat/4005-47144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47144\">Technocrat</a> and <a href=\"/wylde/4005-47145/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47145\">Wylde</a> join the team. Halo and Technocrat’s wife Marissa are killed while the group hides in Gotham City while fighting <a href=\"/azrael/4005-12834/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12834\">Jean-Paul Valley</a> when he was acting as Batman. Luckily, Halo has taken over Marissa’s body, but this is causing Technocrat to have a hard time dealing with her death. The team soon finds that Looker is still alive, but as a vampire and is soon freed from the control of the vampire-lord by her friends.</p><h3>Two Teams</h3><p>The team is soon split after the battle with the vampires. One composed of Geo-Force, Katana, Technocrat and Wylde, the other includes <a href=\"/eradicator/4005-5377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5377\">Eradicator</a>, Looker, Halo and Faust and because of some of the things done by some of the new members are still fugitives. The teams also learn that Halo’s original body has been reborn and is being used by <a href=\"/spectra/4005-50697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50697\">Violet Harper</a>, the evil woman Halo originally controlled. The teams defeat <a href=\"/kobra/4060-55793/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55793\">Kobra</a>, the group that recreated Halo’s body and Harper (now calling herself Spectra with her own powers like Halo’s) as well as <a href=\"/dervish/4005-24927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24927\">Dervish</a> and Windfall. The teams fights Faust’s father <a href=\"/felix-faust/4005-6593/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6593\">Felix Faust</a> who tells Wylde to betray the team in return for being human again, but is turned into a real bear and imprisoned in a zoo after they beat Felix.</p><h3>Arsenal's Outsiders</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/292418-38024-outsiders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292418\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.115\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/292418-38024-outsiders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292418\"><img alt=\"Arsenal's team\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/229/292418-38024-outsiders.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/229/292418-38024-outsiders.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Arsenal's team</figcaption></figure><p>A mysterious conglomerate known as Optitron offered to sponsor the Titans and <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> after summoning them to San Francisco. Before any decisions could be made, a mysterious cybernetic girl (<a href=\"/indigo/4005-3408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3408\">Indigo</a>) from the future invaded the complex - and immediately engaged the team in combat. With half the team out of commission, the remaining members tried to track down Indigo, but instead encountered a rogue <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> android, which had been activated. The destructive robot caused the deaths of Titans <a href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\">Troia</a> and <a href=\"/lilith-clay/4005-12525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12525\">Omen</a>. Indigo arrived and shut down the Superman android, leaving <a href=\"/roy-harper/4005-3404/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3404\">Arsenal</a> and <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing</a> to mourn the fallen Troia.</p><p>Three months later, Arsenal assembled a new team of heroes and persuaded the reluctant Nightwing to join the team as well. Joined by the reformatted Indigo, Metamorpho (actually <a href=\"/shift/4005-3409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3409\">Shift</a>), <a href=\"/jade/4005-3406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\">Jade</a> and new heroes <a href=\"/thunder/4005-3407/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3407\">Thunder</a> and <a href=\"/grace-choi/4005-3405/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3405\">Grace</a>, the team vowed to proactively hunt down villains before they could strike. Nightwing dubbed this new team of heroes The Outsiders, in honor of his mentor's former team and said the team should track down criminals before they do anything wrong.</p><p>During one of their earliest adventures, Roy is critically injured, so he extends an offer to take his place as leader of the Outsiders to <a href=\"/huntress-bertinelli/4005-1690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\">Huntress</a>, which she accepted until Roy was healthy enough to return. Once Roy returned, he would continue to co-lead with Nightwing, but it wasn't like on the Titans. They had a heated confrontation forcing Jade to assume leadership and invite <a href=\"/starfire/4005-2389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2389\">Starfire</a> to join.</p><p>Under Jade's leadership, the team would successfully end a number of criminal organizations, including the metahuman trafficking ring that once victimized Grace. However, Nightwing's feelings about the team grow more ambivalent after finding out their corporate sponsors are a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.</p><p>Soon after, the team was betrayed by Indigo, who was revealed as Brainiac 8. This resulted in Nightwing leaving the team and Roy destroying their headquarters. Jade and Roy restructured the team (no meetings, no headquarters) and bolstered their ranks by recruiting <a href=\"/freddy-freeman/4005-10935/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10935\">Captain Marvel Jr.</a> and original member, Katana.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Escape from Iron Heights</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8191544\" data-ratio=\"0.58842188739096\" data-width=\"1261\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1261px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8191544\"><img alt=\"Outsiders survive the warden's attack\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg 1261w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Outsiders survive the warden's attack\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg 1261w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8191544-rco029_1469312905.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Outsiders survive the warden's attack</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Former Outsider, Black Lightning, was sent to <a href=\"/iron-heights/4020-41410/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41410\">Iron Heights</a> for the death of <a href=\"/martin-somers/4005-86162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86162\">Martin Somers</a>.

Together, they investigated an alien warcraft that Ra’s had recovered and found Kaliber, Karma, and Ishmael dead. They received a message from Ra’s. Disband the team, hand the children over to the League, and kill Shiva for her betrayal, and Ra’s will end his terror on the world.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite most of the team disagreeing with him, Batman believes their most prudent move is to bench the team and give in to Ra’s demands until they can learn more about his alien weapon. His prevailing theory is that it taps into Earth’s electromagnetic field and Lightning could disarm it if he pushes himself beyond his current limits. However, an impatient Lady Shiva convinces Duke and Cassie to go rogue with her. They run down leads until they get Ra’s location from a random League goon, which they share with Batman.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The team regroups in Tokyo, where Ra’s interrupts a meeting of the same consortium that created Babylon and Ishmael. Lightning is able to run interference with the device, while the rest of the team engage in a fight with the League. Once Lightning is able to destroy the device, Ra’s retreats back to the shadows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in Gotham, the future of the team was uncertain, but Sofia ultimately left with Shiva to find herself.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Signal and the Outsiders</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8651737\" data-ratio=\"0.55288461538462\" data-width=\"1040\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1040px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.3%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8651737\"><img alt=\"Signal's clue board\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg 1040w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Signal's clue board\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg 1040w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651737-rco009_1660136744.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Signal's clue board</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Lightning and Katana were having dinner with Metamorpho, catching up on the good old days, when they invite Rex back to the Outsiders along with Signal. Lightning envisioned the Outsiders as a modular team with a revolving fifth member, who could call on the Outsiders to help. Some of the revolving fifth chairs included: Frankenstein, Tim Drake, Green Arrow, and Mister Miracle. Soon after, the team started getting worried that Signal was spreading himself too thin due to him also independently investigating his mothers missing person case. It is at this point that Batman took the fifth chair so the team could make Signal's mission their own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Together, they conclude that Duke's mother is not the only victim of a Joker attack. They think Joker and Scarecrow victims are being kidnapped for having potentially millions of dollars worth of pharmaceuticals in their blood post-exposure. To bait the kidnappers, the Outsiders stage a fight against a mutated Joker victim, who was really Rex in disguise. </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8651733\" data-ratio=\"0.45337620578778\" data-width=\"933\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 933px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.3%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8651733\"><img alt=\"Outsiders vs a new Man-Bat\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg 933w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Outsiders vs a new Man-Bat\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg 933w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8651733-rco018_1663064247.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Outsiders vs a new Man-Bat</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Rex's fake mutant is rerouted to a rehab clinic run by Dr. March, Man-Bat's father-in-law. He had been exposed to the Man-Bat formula looking for a cure on behalf of his daughter, Francine. He hoped to fund a cure among the mutated blood of victim's of other Batman villains. March had all the victims in a zombie-like state, but he turned them feral to keep the Outsiders busy. While they tried rounding up the victims and subduing March's Man-Bat form, Rex got to work on the doctor's files.

Batman goes inside the minds of each member to stop Psycho-Pirate from feeding from their emotions. In the teaser for \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\", the Outsiders return, now with Black Lightning and Katana in comic book accurate outfits and with the addition of Halo and Geo-Force.

      "deck": "A group of robotic superheroes created by William Magnus. Each of them are constructed with a responsometer, a device that gives them human intelligence and personalities and allows them to control their given element.",
      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Metal Men were created by <a href=\"/will-magnus/4005-9536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9536\">Doctor Will Magnu</a><a href=\"/will-magnus/4005-9536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9536\">s</a>, a young, successful, and inventive genius. By the time of the Metal Men's creation, Magnus had already amassed a personal fortune through patent royalties - much of which he invested in his research. The result of one of his projects was a robot made of platinum, female in form, whom Magnus nicknamed <a href=\"/platinum/4005-13685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13685\">Tina</a>.</p><p>Unlike conventional robots limited to certain programmed tasks, Tina was powered by a <a href=\"/responsometer/4055-55710/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55710\">responsometer</a>, a nuclear powered microscopic activator. Not only did this device animate her body, but it endowed the robot with distinct and decidedly human intelligence and personality. It was due to the latter trait that Magnus decided to put Tina in the Science Museum; his activator was too perfect and Tina, to his mind, too much of an annoyance.</p><p>Before Doc Magnus could attend that chore, he was alerted to the menace of a monstrous prehistoric winged creation recently released from its glacial resting place. To combat this radioactive menace, Magnus created an entire team of responsometer- powered robots, each forged from a different metal, each with its own unique strengths. These robots he dubbed his Metal Men.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Metal Men were created by writer <a href=\"/robert-kanigher/4040-43530/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43530\">Robert Kanigher</a>, pencilled by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-29364\">Ross Andru</a> and inked by <a href=\"/mike-esposito/4040-9070/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9070\">Mike Esposito</a> for DC Comics in 1962. The team first appeared in <a href=\"/showcase-37-the-flaming-doom/4000-5788/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-5788\">Showcase #37</a> (March-April 1962) added as last minute fillers. <a href=\"/showcase/4050-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1770\">Showcase</a> was a book that was traditionally used in the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age</a> as a way to test waters for new characters and has spun off many successful new characters such as the <a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Silver Age Flash</a>, <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Silver Age Green Lantern</a>, and <a href=\"/ray-palmer/4005-34685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34685\">Silver Age Atom</a>. After three issues of successful for sales, the Metal Men got spun off into there own <a href=\"/metal-men/4050-2113/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2113\">title</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Like Tina before them, each of the new robots possesses very individual personality traits.</p><ul><li>Intelligent and analytical, <a href=\"/gold/4005-13683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13683\">Gold</a> is the team's acknowledged leader. His golden form has all the physical properties of the metal from which he has been forged: he can stretch into a thin wire miles long, or flatten into a sheet 4 millionths of an inch thick.</li><li><a href=\"/lead/4005-12702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12702\">Lead</a> is rather slow, but big hearted and reliable. His ability to shield against harmful rays and radiation are a frequent and useful asset to the team.</li><li><a href=\"/iron/4005-10017/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10017\">Iron</a> is the Metal Men's strongman. Good natured and friendly, he is the group's powerhouse. He is able to be shaped and formed into an infinite variety of objects to assist the team in its missions.</li><li><a href=\"/mercury/4005-13682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13682\">Mercury</a> is proud, egotistical, and fond of telling anyone who will listen that he is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature.</li><li><a href=\"/tin/4005-13684/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13684\">Tin</a> is the smallest and weakest of the Metal Men, though he is possibly the bravest soul, and is always willing to risk his existence to aid anyone in danger. As a result of his feeling inadequate, Tin stutters, although this impediment often vanishes in the heat of battle.</li><li>A further unofficial member of the team was \"<a href=\"/nameless/4005-37305/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37305\">Nameless</a>\", a robot built by Tin. Shy and withdrawn, Nameless was Tin's \"girlfriend\" until her destruction in battle.</li></ul><p>In the course of their career, the Metal Men have fought a variety of foes, most of them robots created for evil. Perhaps their most unusual and deadliest foe is <a href=\"/chemo/4005-10004/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10004\">Chemo</a> - a walking stew of chemical waste in gigantic humanoid form, mindless and bent on destruction. Among their other foes are the Missile Men, the <a href=\"/gas-gang/4060-57117/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57117\">Gas Gang</a>, B.O.L.T.S., Doctor Yes, and the Plastic Perils.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The Metal Men's exploits brought them worldwide acclaim. Doc Magnus was constantly struggling with his desire to be rid of these human-like robots and their annoying squabbles and the world's need for their unique abillities. He watched as they were repeatedly destroyed and then brought back to life again.</p><p>Magnus eventually retreated into his vast, fully automated research facility and immersed himself in his work. However, the strain proved too much for him and he had a nervous breakdown.</p><p>While Magnus recovered, the Metal Men continued to fight as a team. When he was back to himself, Magnus rebuilt the body of <a href=\"/robotman/4005-4079/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4079\">Robotman</a>, the only survivor of the <a href=\"/doom-patrol/4060-5701/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5701\">Doom Patrol</a> at that time.</p><p>Dr. Magnus and his Metal Men moved out of <a href=\"/california/4020-55716/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\">California</a> and the government put them in <a href=\"/illinois/4020-56565/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56565\">Illinois</a>, where the populous hated them and TV actor <a href=\"/douglas-robot-hunter/4005-66976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66976\">Robot Hunter</a> tried to kill them by bombing Magnus's house.</p><p>Later, the Metal Men were mind controlled by <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\">Max Lord</a> to attack <a href=\"/fire/4005-4439/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4439\">Fire</a>, <a href=\"/ice/4005-2051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2051\">Ice</a> and <a href=\"/rocket-red/4005-2385/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2385\">Rocket Red</a>. The metal men became <a href=\"/alloy/4005-57846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57846\">Alloy</a>, but Ice froze the giant being. They survived this experience.</p><h3>New 52</h3><p>In the New 52 The Metal Men were created by Will Magnus for the army in order to work in hazardous enviroments were normal humans couldn't go. However not long after awakening the group was attacked by Chemo, in order to stop him The Metal Men sacrificed themselves by entering Chemo's body in order to destroy him which also had the unfortunate side effect of destroying their bodies.</p><p>The Metal Men would not be re-activated again until <a href=\"/cyborg/4005-2388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\">Cyborg</a> visited Dr Magnus beseeching him to re-active them so that they could help him fight Grid and stop the <a href=\"/crime-syndicate-of-america/4060-41531/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41531\">Crime Syndicate</a> who had taken over at the time. Dr Magnus was resistant to the idea at first since he had grown attached to the Metal Men and did not want to risk loosing them again, however he eventually agreed.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Imperial Guard was formed centuries ago when a man named <a href=\"/rookshir/4005-64892/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64892\">Rook'Shir</a>, who wielded the power of the phoenix in his blade, was ravaging the <a href=\"/shiar-empire/4020-23199/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23199\">Shi'ar Empire</a>. They ultimately defeated him and hunted down his descendants, as they are the only ones able to wield the blade.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Its members are drawn both from the Shi'ar and other alien races governed by the Shi'ar. The majority of the Imperial Guard's members are known as Borderers. They assist the governors of conquered planets in enforcing the Shi'ar imperial law.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Imperial Guardsmen however belong to the elite corps that protects the ruler of the empire, known as the Majestor or Majestrix, and executes his or her orders. The praetor (leader) of this elite corps is <a href=\"/gladiator/4005-4653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4653\">Gladiator</a>, the most powerful member of the entire Imperial Guard.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The duty of the Imperial Guard is to serve the monarch of the Shi'ar, no matter who it may be. The Guardsmen once aided the mad emperor D'Ken against his rebellious sister <a href=\"/lilandra/4005-6144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6144\">Lilandra</a>, but when Lilandra succeeded D'Ken as ruler, the Guard switched their loyalty to her.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Imperial Guard was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a>, <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/4040-4447/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4447\">Dave Cockrum</a> and <a href=\"/daniel-dan-green/4040-12171/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-12171\">Dan Green</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a href=\"/x-men/4050-2133/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2133\">X-Men</a> # 107. Many of the characters that make up the Imperial Guard are in fact loosely based on many of the characters that make up DC Comics Legion of Superheroes. <a href=\"/scintilla/4005-41010/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41010\">Scintilla</a> for example bearing resemblance to <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/4005-12835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12835\">Shrinking Violet</a>, <a href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-26374/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26374\">Hobgoblin</a> based on <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy</a>, <a href=\"/astra/4005-13339/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13339\">Astra</a> based on <a href=\"/phantom-girl/4005-1257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\">Phantom Girl</a>, and <a href=\"/fang/4005-6090/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6090\">Fang</a> based on <a href=\"/timber-wolf/4005-3619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3619\">Timber Wolf</a>, among many other parallels.  During an early appearance, Wolverine battles (and defeats) Fang, stealing his costume; this battle may have been inspired as a nod to fan speculation about a battle between Wolverine and Timber Wolf.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Guard Shattered</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During a fight with <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Vulcan</a> the Imperial Guard suffered many casualties. Those who died in the fight were: Smasher, Hobgoblin, Cosmos, Neutron, Titan, and Impulse. Oracle and Nightshade were severely injured but they may have survived the battle. Gladiator, Scintilla, Manta, Earthquake, Mentor, and Flashfire survived the battle. Recently Vulcan formed a new <a href=\"/praetorians/4060-56912/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56912\">Imperial Guard</a> using the five most dangerous criminals the Shi'ar Empire has ever captured. They are: <a href=\"/xenith/4005-6140/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6140\">Xenith</a>, <a href=\"/pnzo/4005-59510/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59510\">Pn'Zo</a>, <a href=\"/hodinn/4005-59512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59512\">Hodinn</a>, <a href=\"/uncreated/4005-14855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14855\">Uncreated</a> and <a href=\"/zzzxx/4005-59546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59546\">ZZZXX</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Shi'ar went to war with the <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a>, who were joined by the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>. In a battle between Vulcan and <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, both seemed to be killed. In the aftermath, the Kree, lead by the Inhumans, were the victors. Gladiator became the new Majestor of the Shi'ar with the Inhumans as their overlords. A peace is trying to be formed between the Shi'ar and the Kree.</p><h3>Realm of Kings</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Guard is originally dispatched to the planet Izumbardi, location of the production facilities for the Shi'ar Imperiums finest fleet. After the war with the Inumans, Izumbardi has become disheartened with the entire situation, and has decided to break off rather then remain under Shi'ar rule. This however is unacceptable to the Shi'ar, and as the apparent ruler of the planet is giving his declaration of independence, a scout reports to him that something is coming. It's the Imperial Guard, with guns blazing.</p><figure style=\"width: 688px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1005085\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5174418604651\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1005085\"><img alt=\"The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg 688w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></a><figcaption>The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">But watching the Guard from a command center, Gladiator is finding it hard not to be out in the field again. He knows that as Majestor of the Imperium, he can't aid them in any sort of official capacity, as it would be frowned upon my members of the Shi'ar governing body. But old habits die hard, and as the guard is encountering some major resistance, it's Kallark the turns the tide and saves the day once again. Later as Kallark is receiving reports from the Shi'ar imperial flagship, one of his councilors berates him for taking such action, stating that it's a matter of image. Councilor Araki is dismissed, only to return to a room where the real councilor Araki is being held in a stasis field, as the imposter councilor reveals himself to be the infamous member of the Raptor Society, Talon. Later as the Guard are celebrating their victory, a small scuffle breaks out over whether Gladiator is actually the right person to lead the Imperium. But it's quickly interrupted by the new Praetor Mentor with a message that Gladiator requires them for a briefing, as they'd just volunteered themselves for a mission to the fault. And since the Imperiums fleet is stretched thin, Gladiator has acquired them a special transport team - <a href=\"/starjammers/4060-14871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14871\">The Starjammers</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the fault, the Guard and the Starjammers are assaulted by a massive bio-organic ship, and consumed. The vessel is essentially helpless and as <a href=\"/chod/4005-40789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40789\">Ch'od</a> and Mentor begin repairs on the ship, it's the Guards mission to defend it from alien microbes intent on beginning the digestion process of they're fleshy prison. As Fang, Manta, and Hussar are busy repairing the hull, the exploration team of Flashfire, the new Smasher, and Oracle are returning with enemies on their tail. They're saved as Flashfire returns to cook the microbes alive, and repairs are finished on the ship as they blast they're way out of the belly of the beast. But as they continue their exploration, they find drifting in space the Earth hero <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>, badly damaged and running from none other then monsters of the <a href=\"/the-cancerverse/4020-56640/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56640\">Cancerverse</a>.</p><figure style=\"width: 960px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1059062\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.94166666666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1059062\"><img alt=\"The horrors of the Cancerverse\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The horrors of the Cancerverse</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back on the throne world, Gladiator is saved by the figurative bell, as an attendant draws him from what looks to be an incredibly boring meeting. The M'Kraan Crystal is behaving strangely with power fluctuations, and as Gladiator approaches it, the quantum energies seem to recognize him. Gladiator touches the crystal is is given a mental communication from the Guardsman Oracle who's using Quasar to channel. The message is dire. There's danger at the fault, and the Guard is requesting massive assistance. But Oracle and Quasar can't hold the message for long, Gladiator wishes to go immediately, and even as the true Councilor Araki warns him about this decision, Gladiator can't stand to let his former comrades simply give up their lives in his service.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile back at the Starjammers ship, the Guard is forming a wall of debris and Warstar is laying down a minefield for defense against the inhabitants of the Cancerverse coming to assault them. As the first of the defenses are tripped, Ch'od angrily messages Mentor. Someones sabotaged the ship by removing the Hypderdrive Capacitor. And the only suspect? The newest Smasher, who's on his first tour. As the members of the Guard and the Starjammers confront him, Plutonia grabs some amulets he had behind his back, and the new Smashers disguise is ruined. It's once again, Talon of the Society of Raptors. Talon says that he was only trying to help, and that if the amulets are returned, he can create two new raptors and boost the firepower of the Guard immensely.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back outside, the Cancerverse inhabitants are attacking, but there's something oddly familiar about them. They all resemble members of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, from <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, to <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, and even <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>. A battle ensues, and the Cancerverse's <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> manages to kill Starbolt. It's revealed that the attack is being orchestrated by the Cancerverses version of <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> as some sort of <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> Ship. As things are looking dire for the guard outside, just as Neutron is about to be devoured, something bursts through one of the flesh ships and kills it. Gladiator had joined the battle, bringing along more members of the guard, and using the M'KRaan crystal to transport them all to the fault to aid the rest of the Guard. With Gladiators arrival, the tide of the battle is quickly beginning to shift, but unfortunately, the Guardman Neutron is also killed in battle. Gladiator arrives at the ship for the briefing and is informed of the situation. Like the others, he's incredibly unhappy with Talons presence, but Talon manages to convince them that he can help. He simply needs two volunteers to become Raptors temporarily. So Mentor and Plutonia volunteer, and together with Quasar, the Raptors, and Gladiator, they lead the assault on the inhabitants of the Cancerverse attacking them. When Gladiator feels it's time to withdraw and return to the Imperium, Quasar points out that the enemy seems to be falling back - on orders from the Xavier ship who lets out a massive psychic attack. The Starjammers manage to destroy it, and return to the Imperium. Later, Kallark reports to the Inhuman queen <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a> to explain about what happened at the fault. He warns them of what's coming, and everyone agrees that now more then ever, the Kree and the Shi'ar must be allies.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth 295 - Age of Apocalypse</h3><figure style=\"width: 778px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1770404\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.83419023136247\" data-width=\"778\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1770404\"><img alt=\"AOA\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 778w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"AOA\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 778w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>AOA</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the mentally imbalanced son of Charles Xavier travels back in time, to kill Magneto, he unwittingly creates a new reality in which Apocalypse rules the Earth.

Farley Fleeter lead the group of the Madmen for a while until he decided it was too costly to run around in such outlandish costumes. He did not change his ways he just stopped dressing in the costumes. He would change his mind shortly after when <a href=\"/doctor-alchemy/4005-19089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19089\">Dr. Alchemy </a>paid him to attack Kord industries. Alchemy wanted them to be a distraction while he stole promethium that was being kept at the company. Farley agreed to the terms and was subsequently arrested for his troubles.

They also had their faces and hair painted in different colors. Each ganger basically wore the same costume but had a different colored face and hair. They also all wore facial hair in the form of a goatee.</p><h3>Farley Fleeter's Costume</h3><p>Farley Fleeter's Costume is a camouflage like uniform with bright colors from all his gang membes uniforms. He is also depicted with yellow hair and red face, gloves, boots and briefs. Most of the time he is the only one with any facial hair. He wear a long bushy goatee that he also colors yellow.</p><h3>The Madmen's Costumes</h3><p>There are six other members of Fleeter's gang they are paired in three groups of two. This is seen in their costumes. The ganger in the yellow camouflage costume will have yellow boots, hair, gloves and briefs but his face will be purple. While the purple ganger will be just the opposite with a yellow face. It is the same for the blue and orange gangers and, the green and red gangers.</p>",

Later, while battling the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League</a> and their successors, the second Royal Flush Gang, the original King, Queen and Ten were killed.</p><h3>The Second Gang</h3><p>Started by <a href=\"/hector-hammond/4005-10210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10210\">Hector Hammond</a>, the second Gang was the only one with full identities for nearly everyone. He changed the suit to <strong>spades</strong> and recruited new members:</p><p>*<strong>Ace</strong> (real name <a href=\"/ace/4005-28702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28702\">Derek Reston</a>) was an android with super-strength in the form of a man.</p><p>*<strong>King</strong> (real name <a href=\"/king/4005-19126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19126\">Joe Carny</a>) became immortal due to the metagene bomb and had the power of mind control.</p><p>*<strong>Queen</strong> (real name <a href=\"/queen/4005-22284/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22284\">Mona Taylor</a>) could create realistic illusions and had a wrist shooter that fired spades.</p><p>*<strong>Jack</strong> (real name unknown) had one real eye and one eye which was a laser weapon. He also had an energy-charged sword.</p><p>*<strong>Ten</strong> (real name <a href=\"/ten/4005-28701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28701\">Wanda Wayland</a>) had energy blasters in her gloves and carried explosive playing cards.</p><p>Ten also had pre-teen <a href=\"/henchmen/4015-57632/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-57632\">henchmen</a> that extended the Royal Flush Gang called Ten's Little Indians. <a href=\"/danny-chase/4005-28700/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28700\">Danny Chase</a> went undercover for the <a href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\">New Titans</a>.</p><h3>Third Gang</h3><p>In <a href=\"/superman-the-man-of-steel/4050-4571/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4571\">Superman: The Man of Steel</a>, the Royal Flush Gang had expanded all across America. Instead of only five members, each group had fifty-two, and four suits.</p><h3>Infinite Crisis Gang</h3><p>The Royal Flush Gang joined <a href=\"/alex-luthor/4005-24087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24087\">Alexander Luthor's</a> <a href=\"/secret-society-of-super-villains/4060-40433/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40433\">Secret Society of Super Villains</a>. The Joker, after being rejected from society, kills all fifty-two members of a Gang in a casino.</p><h3>Post-Crisis Gang</h3><p>In <i>Justice League of America</i> Vol. 2 # 35, a new version of the Royal Flush Gang appears. This new gag works under Amos Fortune's authority, who is addressed as \"Wild Card\" by his other members. He gives a history of the gang that combines the first and third gang's histories/characteristics, with Amos indicating that he was always running the group in some capacity.</p><p>There are multiple active, costumed members as some of them derive their outfits and code-names from with pip values lower than ten. Members can also raise in numerical ranks as a reward for their success, or be \"dealt out\" at the discretion by their leader.</p><p>It's unclear if there are still 52 cells throughout the country, or that there are 52 members it total as a lower ranked member mentions that there are four Queens, but Amos states that the group is constantly growing.</p><p>The latest Royal Flush Gang has gone toe to toe with <a href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\">Zatanna</a> when she took her show to Las Vegas. This gang has designed their motif to represent Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack for the exception of Queen. Jack looks alot like Sammy Davis Jr. but he calls himself \"The Candyman.\" King, of course, bears a striking resemblance to Frank Sinatra, the Chairman of the Board and Ace represents Sinatra's right hand man Dean Martin. Zatanna defeats the gang when she summons the neon lit cowboy on the Vegas Strip, to do her bidding. The cowboy grabs the gang and tosses each of them into a different corner of Vegas thereby knocking them out for the authorities.</p><h3>New 52</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4577855\" data-ratio=\"0.66147859922179\" data-width=\"1028\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1028px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4577855\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.png 1028w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4577855-6686913100-they-.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>In the<a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\"> New 52</a>, a new version of the Gang appear and battle the <a href=\"/rogues/4060-41466/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41466\">Rogues</a> during the events of <a href=\"/forever-evil/4045-57223/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-57223\"><em>Forever Evil</em></a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3><a href=\"/super-friends/4060-40395/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40395\">Super Friends</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49448/3392857-rpyal%20flush%20gang.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3392857\" data-ratio=\"0.72803347280335\" data-width=\"478\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 478px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49448/3392857-rpyal%20flush%20gang.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3392857\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49448/3392857-rpyal%20flush%20gang.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49448/3392857-rpyal%20flush%20gang.jpg 478w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49448/3392857-rpyal%20flush%20gang.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The Gang appear in the final season of the show, led by the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> (disguised as Ace).

This version of the Gang was lead by Ace, the illusion casting young girl from previous <em>Justice League</em> episodes. Ace uses psychic abilities to wreak havoc on Metropolis and imbue ordinary people with special abilities, making them her Royal Flush Gang. This version showed different versions of the Gang, all based on some sort of popular culture reference: King was a large floating head, much resembling Marvel's supervillain<a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\"> MODOK</a>, a villainous creature created by Jack Kirby (often referred to as \"the King of Comics\"); Queen was a man who had been transformed into a large, operatic, drag-queen style woman with a powerful scepter; Jack wielded a samurai sword and sported kabuki style makeup, resembling the then-popular Cartoon Network Series character Samurai Jack; and Ten was based on Bo Derek's iconic performance in the 1979 movie \"Ten,\" with prehensile braids that could be extended from her head. Once Batman convinced Ace to stop using her powers and return Metropolis to its former state before dying of an impending brain aneurysm, the Royal Flush Gang were returned to their former selves as well.</p><h3><a href=\"/batman-beyond/4075-116/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-116\">Batman Beyond</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4577850\" data-ratio=\"0.49348769898698\" data-width=\"691\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 691px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4577850\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg 691w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg 691w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577850-9435284656-encyc.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The gang in this series was a family of thieves. <b>King</b> and <b>Queen</b> are married, and their children serve as <b>Jack</b> and <b>Ten</b>. They are also accompanied by a super strong android called <b>Ace</b>.</p><p>After the gang was arrested, a new Royal Flush Gang makes a sudden appearance on the Deuce's Wild Floating Casino. Batman (<a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/terry-mcginnis/4005-40501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40501\">Terry McGinnis</a>) was outnumbered and the the gang escapes but he did learn a few things that seemed out of place. This gang travelled without Ten, Ace's body seemed soft when Terry laid a few punches as if he were human rather than an android and the actual Royal Flush Gang was still in prison. Terry goes to the newly renovated Blackgate Penitentiary in order to find out if the Royal Flush Gang has found a way to sneak out of prison to conduct their crimes before their parole. Terry observes King and Queen having a private call with Melanie aka Ten, who is currently serving time in juvie. Melanie had heard about the copycat Royal Flush Gang and wanted know if her parents were behind it but King abruptly ends the call because he was still disappointed in her for her disobedience.</p><p>Bruce calls in Terry, telling him to quit the recon and to react to a break in at the No Trump Jewelry Store. Someone that looks like Ten is stealing the Broken Heart Diamond. Terry intercepts Ten's escape. She reacts by throwing sharp playing cards at Terry but Terry dodges them with a manhole which causes the cards to ricochet back at Ten. One card slits Ten's left cheek and Terry makes his way to apprehending her. As Terry gets close, Ten slips an electrical playing card that shocks Terry and Ten makes her escape. Terry destroys the card and heads to juvie hall where Ten is being held. Terry arrives to notice Ten walking as part of a chain gang back to her cell block. Terry also notices that Ten doesn't have scar on her left cheek.</p><p>Bruce figures out that King and Queen have twin siblings. Each King married a Queen but their offsprings turned out different. The original King and Queen had Melanie and Jack Walker while the copycat King and Queen only had one daughter that looked similar to Melanie. Both families had criminal tendencies and the copycat King shared a cell with two men that looked similar to Jack and Ace. Terry figures out what the copycat gang is up to. They were ridiculing the original gang in prison with their thefts and now the copycats will kill the original gang at their parole hearing.</p><p>Terry manages to save three members of the original gang and defeats the copycats but King screws up the parole hearing when he holds Batman as well as the parole board hostage. Fortunately, the gun that King held only responds to the fingerprint recognition of a prison guard. Terry detains the original gang and heads toward juvie hall. The guards at juvie hall try to break into Melanie's cell but it was locked from the inside. Terry uses his suit's super strength to kick down the door and begins to console Melanie because she has her copycat cousin kneeling on the floor. Melanie wants to bash in her cousin's head with a scepter for all the misery her uncle and aunt brought her family but Terry's words get through to her. Melanie drops the scepter and her cousin is apprehended.</p><p>The next day, Terry learns that the copycat gang are being processed for their crimes while the Walkers await the parole board's decision. The parole board deems the Walkers except for Melanie unfit for parole at this time. Melanie experiences mixed feelings. For instance, she is overjoyed to be released from juvie but she is saddened that her mother and brother will continue to be incarcerated at Blackgate because of King's actions. But most of all, she feels let down because as she looks back at the courtroom, she notices that Terry wasn't present at her hearing. However, Terry was there but Bruce convinced Terry to leave so there would be no second thoughts of rekindling a lost love affair.</p><p>After Jack was released from prison, Melanie got him a job at the restaurant where she worked at, as a dish washer but that didn't last for too long. Jack usurped his father's position as King and started a series of tryouts for local street punks who wanted to become the new founding members of the Royal Flush Gang. Terry tails one street punk named Gary that has just committed a burglary. Terry beats up Gary and leaves him for the police. The next day, Bruce gets intel from Barbara and relays it back to Terry. According to Barbara's interrogation, Gary was bragging about how his burglary was an initiation to become a member of the Royal Flush Gang.</p><p>Terry goes to Melanie for help and she agrees to end this nightmare once and for all. Melanie goes to visit King at Blackgate to learn about any hideouts that the gang used to meet at after Melanie was cast out of the gang. At first, King refuses to help Melanie and begins to taunt her about how rehabilitation has rewarded her as well as Jack. Melanie informs King that Jack has taken his position of power and is starting a new Royal Flush Gang. King becomes infuriated and tells Melanie everything.</p><p>Jack and his new Queen welcome the new members to their gang. Since the software in the Ace android was outdated, Jack initiated a techno savy midget named Chet who can control Ace by via remote control body suit. As for the new Jack, a street punk named Wyatt takes the position. As for Jack's new Queen and Ten, their identities remain unknown. However, its possible that Ten is Melanie's identical cousin who has also not been named while Queen maybe Sable Thorpe, King's replacement Queen who double crossed Paxton Powers during Bruce's attempted assassination. Suddenly, Melanie and Terry crash the party. Melanie expresses her disappointment in regards to Jack's relapse into crime but Jack tells her that he has no regrets. Terry and Melanie easily defeat the new gang while the police arrive to cart the gang off to Blackgate.</p><h3><a href=\"/batman-the-brave-and-the-bold/4075-109/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-109\">Batman: The Brave &amp; the Bold</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4577840\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4577840\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg 720w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg 720w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4577840-5208423555-Royal.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In the opening scene of an episode called \"Return of the Fearsome Fangs,\" the gang in this series are a gang of bandits in the Old West fighting <a href=\"/jonah-hex/4005-3614/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3614\">Jonah Hex</a>.

After one of their own, the renegade Oan <a href=\"../../krona/29-27246/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Krona</a>, performed an experiment that nearly annihilated all of creation, the Oans promised from that moment forward to combat evil throughout all regions of space, no matter how desolate, as the self-appointed <a href=\"../../guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Guardians Of The Universe</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Green Lantern Corps were created by <a href=\"/john-broome/4040-48152/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-48152\">John Broome</a> and <a href=\"/gil-kane/4040-1764/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1764\">Gil Kane</a>.

The Guardians realized their failure with the <a href=\"/the-manhunters/4060-55857/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55857\">Manhunters</a> was due to their creation's single-mindedness, lack of emotion (such as fear and courage), and most importantly, the absence of morality and honor in the androids. The Guardians chose to assign sentient beings that excelled in fearlessness and morality. These beings would then watch over their sector of the universe. The sector that includes <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a> is Sector 2814. The mission of the Green Lantern Corps is to protect the universe from interstellar threats of all kinds, ranging from planetary-level threats(problems that could annihilate an entire civilization) to cosmic-level threats(problems that could annihilate the entire universe).</p><p>Each member has a great deal of autonomy as to their methods in their jurisdiction, subject to review by the Guardians if they feel the Green Lantern in question has abused their assigned authority. The individual Lanterns are responsible for arranging their replacements (when possible) if they are near retirement or death. If a Lantern dies before that obligation is met, the ring will find and seek another to be trained on its own. In rare circumstances, Guardians will personally go out into the field to recruit a replacement.</p><p>Upon recruitment each Green Lantern in the original Corps received a <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Power Ring</a>, a <a href=\"/power-battery/4055-55747/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55747\">Power Battery</a> shaped like a lantern (with which the ring is recharged), and a uniform. The default uniform design for humanoids was a green section covering the torso and shoulders, black arms and leggings, green boots, white gloves, green domino mask and a chest symbol of a stylized Green Lantern icon on a white circle. Lanterns were allowed to customize their uniforms as long as the color scheme and the symbol were present. When the nature of the being precludes a standard uniform, an equivalent arrangement is expected as a substitute. For instance, <a href=\"../../mogo/29-41919/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mogo</a>, a sentient planet, arranges his foliage to create a green circling band and lantern symbol on his body. <a href=\"../../jack-t-chance/29-45059/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jack T. Chance</a>, a humanoid, refused to wear a uniform, but conceded to wearing a badge on the lapel of his coat. Lanterns were also allowed the option of a secret identity as a security measure and it is implied that the Corps were instructed to honor that choice by taking care not to expose them. Training in the use of the ring is mandatory for all rookie Lanterns and appropriate facilities and personnel are available on Oa upon request. In addition, a senior Lantern can be assigned to coach a recruit while in the field of their sector. The Corps was destroyed when Hal Jordan was possessed by <a href=\"../../parallax/29-41293/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Parallax</a>, But it was rebuilt when Hal Jordan sacrificed himself to stop the <a href=\"../../sun-eater/29-47363/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sun-Eater</a>.</p><h3>Post-Final Night</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/1857622-1307864404.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1857622\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5824175824176\" data-width=\"455\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 455px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/1857622-1307864404.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1857622\"><img alt=\"Green Lantern Corps (Post-Final Night)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/99801/1857622-1307864404.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/99801/1857622-1307864404.jpg 455w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" data-width=\"455\"></a><figcaption>Green Lantern Corps (Post-Final Night)</figcaption></figure><p>The new Green Lantern Corps being built by the Guardians is far more formal and structured than the old one that was destroyed by <a href=\"../../parallax/29-41293/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Parallax</a>. Recruits, after being found by their Power Rings, are taken to Oa for training. Not all recruits will make it through training - indeed a great many of them might even fail, forcing the ring to find another candidate. Lantern trainees have a simplified version of the old Green Lantern uniform (with green covering more of the torso) with the white circle on their chest blank, presumably until the Lantern insignia is added upon completion of their training. Additionally, all Power Rings, not just <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a>'s ring, now work on the color yellow, provided the user can feel the fear behind the color and overcome it.</p><p>Each member is given a <a href=\"../../lantern-power-ring/18-41361/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lantern Power Ring</a>. The ring can create constructs that take the form of whatever the wielder imagines, so long as they have the willpower to channel and control the energies of the ring. The ring is limited only by the wearers' own fear and uncertainty. For this reason the ring is considered \"The Most Powerful Weapon in the Universe\". The power ring has its own intelligence and is able to understand the thoughts of the wearer. Though the ring itself is not sentient, if a Lantern is to ever die the ring is able to find a worthy successor. The ring does have a finite amount of energy before having to be recharged. Some Green Lanterns speak an oath to strengthen their will and reaffirm their determination during this time of recharge. The energy source of all this is fed by the <a href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\">Central Power Battery</a> of Oa.</p><h3>In The 30th Century (Silver Age)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108841/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2315199\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108841/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2315199\"><img alt=\"Green Lantern Corps (30th Century - Silver Age)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108841/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108841/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Green Lantern Corps (30th Century - Silver Age)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108841/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/108841/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Green Lantern Corps (30th Century - Silver Age)</figcaption></figure><p>In the latter part of the 30th Century, the Green Lantern Corps main goal was not interfering with U.P. planets(the reason is currently unknown).

The first being <a href=\"/rond-vidar/4005-12860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12860\">Vidar</a>, who was sent to Earth to stop certain experiments that could've revealed how the universe came into existence. The second Green Lantern was his son, Rand Vida, whose mission was stop his villainous father from conquering the planet.</p><h3>In The 30th Century (Retro-boot)</h3><p>The Green Lantern Corps has now been destroyed, with Rand Vida being the last living Lantern. When Rand was killed by <a href=\"/superboy-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy-Prime</a>, his ring scanned the sector for a replacement, only to find none existed.

The ring was then snatched by the Daxamite <a href=\"/sodam-yat/4005-46185/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46185\">Sodam Yat</a>. When Mon-El returned Vidar’s body to Oa, Sodam Yat, who is now the last of the Guardians of the Universe, demanded to know who would dare disturb the resting place of the Green Lantern Corps.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Manhunters</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1196603-manhunterrobot05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1196603\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1196603-manhunterrobot05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1196603\"><img alt=\"Manhunters\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-width=\"533\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58245/1196603-manhunterrobot05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58245/1196603-manhunterrobot05.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Manhunters\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58245/1196603-manhunterrobot05.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58245/1196603-manhunterrobot05.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-width=\"533\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Manhunters</figcaption></figure><p>The first attempt by the Guardians at regulating and fighting evil was the creation of a android army they called the <a href=\"../../the-manhunters/65-55857/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Manhunters</a>. They were effective at policing the universe for nearly a thousand years. Eventually the Manhunters became more dedicated to the pursuit of their quarry than to the administration of justice. This along with the belief that the Oans were restricting their potential, which led the robots to rebel. The Oans quelled the rebellion and disbanded the Manhunters by destroying them, but a few survived. They still challenge the Guardians to this day with their severe brand of justice, and have made the Green Lantern Corps their mortal enemy.</p><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></p><p>During Crisis on Infinite Earths the Guardians of the Universe leave Oa.

The members of the Corpse follow different rules than normal Lanterns, and in fact most don’t even know of their existence. One example being that they were not bound by the use of Lethal Force even before the <a href=\"../../sinestro-corps-war/39-50650/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sinestro Corps War</a>. (Gardner mentioned during a mission with them that he’d never heard of the Corpse, and after the mission his memory of them was erased.) Not much is known about the Corpse, though what is known pertains simply to their duties. Members of the Corpse do not use power rings like most Lanterns; instead they are given coin-like disks which when swallowed give them all of the same abilities for a limited amount of time. The energy produced by these disks is purple, as opposed to the usual green (though it is unknown with the recent revelations about the Emotional Spectrum what this means). Corpsemen do not wear the traditional green of other Lanterns, and under no conditions do they dawn the symbol. They tend to instead wear black uniforms that have no symbols, appropriate for their station. With the recent authorization of Lethal Force against Sinestro Corps members and other enemies of the Lanterns after the war, the need for the continuation of the Corpse is in question by some. Though there will likely remain a need for those who work in the shadows.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Alpha Lanterns</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-353591\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5023923444976\" data-width=\"209\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 209px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-353591\"><img alt=\"No Lantern Escapes The Alpha Lanterns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns.jpg 209w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Lantern Escapes The Alpha Lanterns\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No Lantern Escapes The Alpha Lanterns</figcaption></figure><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/alpha-lanterns/4060-49719/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49719\">Alpha Lanterns</a></p><p>After the Sinestro Corps War the Guardians create a new class of Green Lantern called the <a href=\"../../alpha-lanterns/65-49719/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alpha Lanterns</a>. The Alpha Lanterns are seasoned Corpsmen who have been fused with their Power Rings and Batteries. <a href=\"../../boodikka/29-2060/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Boodikka</a>, <a href=\"../../varix/29-49682/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Varix</a>, <a href=\"../../kraken/29-49677/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"../../green-man/29-47281/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Green Man</a> and <a href=\"../../chaselon/29-46423/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Chaselon</a> are all confirmed Alpha Lanterns; Hal Jordan is notably not chosen, and <a href=\"../../john-stewart/29-10451/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Stewart</a> is chosen but he declines the position.</p><p>The Alpha Lanterns function as Internal Affairs for the Green Lanterns Corps - Hal Jordan refers to them in the same manner. They have \"the sentient drive and thought process of the Green Lanterns and the efficiency and logic of The Manhunters,\" as the Guardians turn them into cyborgs using Manhunter technology, and mainline their minds directly to The Book of Oa and the Central Battery. After the transformation, an Alpha Lantern would receive an additional power ring. Similarly to the most recent generation of Manhunters, Alpha Lanterns have a secondary face which can drain a Power Ring of its energy. The Alpha Lanterns tend to chant the Manhunter-like slogan \"No Lantern escapes the Alpha Lanterns\".</p><p><a href=\"../../laira/29-46403/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Laira</a> was the first Green Lantern to be punished by the Alpha Lanterns; for the crime of killing <a href=\"../../amon-sur/29-42351/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Amon Sur</a> she was stripped of her powers and expelled from the Corps.At some point during Final Crisis, the Alpha Lantern Kraken is possessed by the spirit of the deceased New God, Granny Goodness, and manages to frame Hal Jordan for a murder he did not commit. By the time the Corps. finds out who the guilty party is, Granny Goodness reveals her plan to steal the power of the Central power battery for Darkseid. Injuring one of the Guardians using her ability to suppress the Green, she is restrained by the Krona Protocol by the other Guardians, and shut down.</p><p>During Blackest Night, Chaselon was killed by the Black Lanterns and his inner battery was used as a bomb by Kyle Rayner to get rid of all the Black Lanterns around the Main Lantern Battery. After the return of the Guardians and the end of the Blackest Night, the Alpha Lanterns are seen forcing other Lanterns to become Alphas against their will. Boodika also requests the military advice of John Stewart, who the Guardians summon to their chamber to inform him of his new assignment.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Prominent Members</h2><p>Due to the presence of the <a href=\"/white-lantern-corps/4060-57420/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57420\">White Lantern</a> on <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>, it was decided that no Green Lantern Corps Members would come from Earth in order to protect its location. This changed when <a href=\"/abin-sur/4005-22634/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22634\">Abin Sur</a> crashed on Earth and his ring chose Hal Jordan. Since then Guy Gardner, John Stewart and Kyle Rayner have all represented Earth as a Corps member. Another prominent members of the Corps was Sinestro, who later went on to be on the Corps major enemies.</p><p>Numerous families have a tradition of serving in the Corps, notably those of <a href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\">Arisia</a>, and the father daughter legacy of Sinestro and <a href=\"/soranik-natu/4005-42284/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42284\">Soranik Natu</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>The Space Sectors</h2><p>The Corps has expanded to an organization of 7200 Green Lanterns, with the average ratio of two Lanterns per sector. It is required that each sector have at least two Lanterns, but it can have more depending on the population of that sector. Also there is a reserve force located on Oa. The organization of the sectors is simple, the universe is divided into 3600 equally sized \"pie\" shapes. All the points meet at the planet Oa, which is located in the center of the universe. Since the sectors all meet and begin on Oa, this means that Oa is in every Lantern's sector, and while a Lantern is on Oa, he or she is technically still patrolling his home sector.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film and Television</h3><p>In the <a href=\"../../dc-animated-universe/12-44865/\" rel=\"nofollow \">DC Animated Universe</a>, the Green Lantern corp made five appearances and were relatively unchanged.

      "description": "<h2>Origins of the Scrier </h2> <p>Scrier is a seemingly ancient cult based on an ancient being of great power that may or may not have existed also named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64854\" href=\"/scrier/4005-64854/\"> Scrier</a>. The Brotherhood of Scrier all wear identical costumes and masks. Together they are dedicated to obtaining more power.  <br />  </p> <h2>Enter: Norman Osborn</h2> <p>While seemingly mystical in nature and power like the being they model themselves after, in reality, their \"powers\" stem from sophisticated technology created by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31354\" href=\"/professor-mendel-stromm/4005-31354/\"> Mendel Stromm </a>at the behest of<a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\">  Norman Osborn</a>. Norman Osborn joined  the cult while hiding in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56099\" href=\"/europe/4020-56099/\"> Europe</a> following his <a data-ref-id=\"4045-43220\" href=\"/the-death-of-gwen-stacy/4045-43220/\"> \"death\"</a> and eventually rose to the head of the organization after disposing of the cult's head Scrier. Still believed to be dead, Osborn used the Scrier cult as his personal eyes and ears for years, as well as his personal minions to further his own goals.  <br /> <br />It was Osborn who instructed a Scrier to bring tissue samples of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\"> Peter Parker </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\" href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\"> Gwen Stacy </a>to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\" href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\"> Miles Warren </a>in ordered to be cloned for Warren's own twisted ends, which Osborn would later use for his own purposes. Osborn also used a Scrier to befriend a mutant who could also alter people's perceptions named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15469\" href=\"/judas-traveller/4005-15469/\"> Judas Traveller </a>so that Osborn could use Traveller as a pawn against Spider-Man and Ben Reilly, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\" href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\"> Scarlet Spider</a>.  Traveller was later betrayed by the majority of his<a data-ref-id=\"4060-55972\" href=\"/host/4060-55972/\">  Host </a>and the Scrier; Traveller hasn't been seen since. After Miles Warren returned as the Jackal, Osborn instructed a Scrier to confront him to stop the Jackal's mad scheme to unleash his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14507\" href=\"/carrion/4005-14507/\"> Carrion</a> virus and replace the world's population with <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55828\" href=\"/clone/4015-55828/\"> clones</a>. While unsuccessful, it did buy time for Spider-Man and the Scarlet Spider to stop him.  <br /> <br />Following his return, Norman Osborn continued using the Scrier, including the procuring of an object of great interest from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15631\" href=\"/alison-mongrain/4005-15631/\"> Alison Mongrain</a>, which also brought them into direct confrontation with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\" href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\"> Kaine</a>. They managed to apparently persevere, but this was never ellaborated on, even when Kaine made his eventual return some time later. <br /> </p> <h2>MC2-Universe</h2>The Scrier later became embroiled in an ongoing war with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\"> Spider-Girl</a>, daughter of the true Spider-Man. They later broke Roderick Kingsley, the original <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\" href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\"> Hobgoblin</a>, out of prison to use against Spider-Girl in hopes of finishing her off. Although he Hobgoblin failed to kill Spider-Girl, he then severed all ties with the Scrier so he could concentrate on his own scheme, which centered around becoming the new <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\" href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\"> Kingpin of Crime</a>.",

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p><a href=\"/cobra-commander/4005-11034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11034\">Cobra Commander</a> was living on the road and doing scams and con jobs to earn a living. He became increasingly egotistical yet paranoid, citing all of his issues were the fault of the corrupt American system that always kept the little guy down. These views and feelings sparked great ambition of wreaking vengeance upon the businesses and governments of the system. He began seeking out individuals who shared his desires to topple these entities and used money from various schemes to attract followers. When he began having meetings with these new found followers, was when he first started wearing the blue hood to mask his identity.</p><p>The organization grew and he moved it to the town of <a href=\"/springfield/4020-56548/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56548\">Springfield</a>, a place where the economy had crumbled and the population had become desperate. Using his criminal wits and charisma, he quickly garnered the support of the townsfolk and had their gratitude and loyalty and gained complete control of the town. With this new base of followers he established the paramilitary group <a href=\"/cobra/4060-7417/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7417\">Cobra</a>, a cartel that promised wealth and power to its members as long as they were willing to be completely loyal and use any means necessary to achieve their goals.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The President/CEO of <a href=\"/hasbro/4010-2697/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2697\">Hasbro</a> attended a charity event that <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel</a> Comic’s President was also attending. The two ended up in the men’s room and began discussing each other’s respective businesses when the Hasbro exec mentioned that he wanted to reactivate the trademark <a href=\"/gi-joe/4060-12206/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-12206\">G.I. Joe</a> line but was struggling to devise a new approach. The Marvel exec stated that they employ the best creative people in the world and to let them bring in <a href=\"/jim-shooter/4040-40450/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40450\">Jim Shooter</a>, then editor-in-chief for Marvel Comics to solve the re-launch problem.</p><p>Before G.I. Joe’s re-launch, <a href=\"/larry-hama/4040-12272/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-12272\">Larry Hama</a> was working on a new concept for a comic book called Fury Force, which he hoped to launch as a new ongoing series for Marvel Comics. The original idea was <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a> would assemble an elite team of soldiers to battle neo-Nazi terrorists from an organization called <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a>. The idea was shot down, but Hama carried over the basic outline to the G.I. Joe project. Now with all of that in place, G.I. Joe needed a nemesis, which is where Cobra, unofficially credited to <a href=\"/archie-goodwin/4040-42923/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42923\">Archie Goodwin</a>, was invented.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Cobra Chain of Command</h3><h4>Commander-In-Chief</h4><ul><li><b>Cobra Commander</b> - The leader and founder of Cobra. His face is almost always obscured either by a hood with only his eyes visible or by a high tech battle helmet with various security features integrated into it, to maintain the secret of his civilian identity.

He has a personal army called the \" <a href=\"/iron-grenadiers/4005-7679/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7679\">Iron Grenadiers</a>\".</li></ul><h4>Intelligence</h4><ul><li><b>The Baroness</b> aka <b>Baroness Anastasia DeCobray</b> - The daughter of rich European aristocrats and never wanted for anything. Her brother was killed, and she believed an American soldier by the name of <a href=\"/snake-eyes/4005-6452/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6452\">Snake Eyes</a> was the killer, which drove her toward the Cobra organization. She serves as Cobra's Director of Intelligence and is romantically involved with Destro. She and Destro had a son named <a href=\"/laird-destro/4005-7772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7772\">Alexander McCullen</a>. The son, Baroness and a former British soldier, <a href=\"/mistress-armada/4005-14139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14139\">Lilian Osborne</a> teamed up to seize control of a revitalized Cobra at one point.</li><li><b>Mistress Armada</b> aka <b>Lilian Osbourne –</b> Lilian teamed up with Alexander McCullen while in military training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. She helped Alexander gain control of his father’s company and pose as Destro. Destro eventually brought Alexander and Lilian down and got them into custody. It is unknown what his plans are for the pair for their roles in impersonating him and taking control of his business.</li><li><b><a href=\"/vypra/4005-63677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63677\">Vypra</a></b> aka <b>Ann A. Conda –</b> A martial arts specialist that trained privately and disregarded joining the military because she felt soldiers were “wimps”. She signed up with Cobra, liking both the name and the attitude of the organization. She ascended through the ranks quickly and proved herself as someone not to be underestimated. <a href=\"/hawk/4005-11102/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11102\">General Hawk</a> regarded her as one of the nastier threats to come out of Cobra’s ranks in years.</li></ul><h4>Destro’s Personal Troops</h4><ul><li><b><a href=\"/scrap-iron/4005-11036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11036\">Scrap Iron</a></b> – Head product designer for Destro’s armament corporation. He carries out all initial field testing on all new armor, weapons and other creations. His main area of expertise is remote-launched, laser-guided, rocket-propelled piezoelectric fused anti-tank weapons. While some weapons systems are classified as “Smart” weapons, his are often known by the nomenclature of “Brilliant.”</li><li><b><a href=\"/metal-head/4005-63621/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63621\">Metal Head</a></b> – This “Walking Anti-Tank Weapon” can launch high-explosive missiles from his backpack or hip holster tubes and guide them to their target via a laser beam, without using his hands or feet. His targeting and weapons system is completely voice-activated and highly sophisticated. It’s as simple as visually acquire a target, let the computer calculate range and path trajectory and give a green light, to which he yells “Bang!” to commence firing.</li><li><b>Annihilators</b> – Destro’s personal bodyguards and elite airborne assault troops. They are versatile and can be deployed from land, sea and air via mini-turbine Heli-packs on their backs. They are well armored and are the elite of the elite recruits from Destro’s Iron Grenadier forces. They also serve an apprenticeship as hard-sell telephone sales negotiators for Destro’s M.A.R.S. armament corporation.</li><li><b>Ferrets</b> – The backbone of Destro’s armored assault squadron. They are the pilots of the <a href=\"/demon/4055-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56002\">D.E.M.O.N</a>’s and conduct long range attacks in battle to neutralize enemy strong points, as well as capturing LZ’s (Landing Zones) for airborne insertions.</li><li><b>Iron Grenadiers</b> – The Iron Grenadiers are personally selected from Destro’s personal bodyguards to spearhead his incursions into new territories. The Iron Grenadiers act as agents, provocateurs, saboteurs or terrorists, anything to propel an unsuspecting country towards chaos and turmoil, which creates new markets for Destro’s weapons business.</li><li><b><a href=\"/nullifier/4005-63609/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63609\">Nullifiers</a></b> – The Pilots of the <a href=\"/agp/4055-56251/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56251\">A.G.P (Anti-Gravity Pods)</a>, which are quick, small, sharply maneuverable aircraft. Unfortunately this type of aircraft is punishing on the human body, so to become a Nullifier, one must be in peak physical condition and maintain an six hour weight workout every day to maintain the physique and high levels of endurance required to command the A.G.P.</li><li><a href=\"/targat/4005-63618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63618\"><b>T</b><b>.A.R.G.A.T.S.</b></a> – Trans Atmospheric Rapid Global Assault Trooper aka TARGATS are Destro’s leading technological soldier. With breakthroughs from Destro’s technicians, the TARGATS can be deployed into orbit from a shuttle, wearing armored self-contained bio-system suits and ceramic composite heat shields that double as hang gliders and weapons platforms. Their re-entry over their target is usually mistaken for a meteor shower, which shocks and stuns their enemy.</li><li><b><a href=\"/wild-boar/4005-63620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63620\">Wild Boars</a></b> – The Wild Boars are the drivers of the <a href=\"/razorback/4055-56232/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56232\">Razorback</a>, which is a principle front-line assault vehicle with impressive firepower capabilities. It is able to destroy an enemy vehicle within minutes.

He is a master of disguise able to be anyone anytime he wishes. Thanks to genetic experimentation, Zartan is also capable of changing his skin color to blend in with his background. This special ability is disrupted by sunlight.</li></ul><h4>Dreadnoks</h4><ul><li><b><a href=\"/zanya/4005-7709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7709\">Zanya</a> –</b> The daughter of the leader, Zartan, she became known as the “Dreadnok Princess.” Initially Zartan tried to send her away from the Dreadnoks after she tracked him down, but she was persistent and eventually accepted into the Dreadnoks. She took to their way of live with a fervor, finding her father and his band of misfits to be the coolest guardians she could ask for.</li><li><b><a href=\"/zandar/4005-7694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7694\">Zandar</a> –</b> Zartan’s brother and another master of camouflage and covert movement. He’s good at hiding and sneaking up on people, needless to say he doesn’t sneak up on people to do them any good.

While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly and finish each others sentences, it is also a liability, as they feel each others pain during fights. Tomax and Xamot are mirror images of each other, except Xamot has a scar on the right side of his face.

He was ordered to leave his friend behind, but he ignored the orders and rescued Snake Eyes, saving him from certain death. He brought Snake-Eyes into his clan; the two became sword brothers. He joined Cobra with the intention of finding the man who killed his uncle, the leader of his clan.

They also have a defect that causes them to burst into flames when hit from behind.</li><li><b>B</b><b>.A.A.T.S</b> – Battle Armored Android Troopers were totally artificial robotic troopers with primitive logic circuits. They could sustain enormous amounts of damage and still continue with their mission objectives. The new B.A.A.T.s has been re-designed with less artificial intelligence than before because their circuits have been modified for weapons and assault capabilities only. Battle destruction and elimination of G.I. Joe forces were the only parameters programmed into the circuitry of these walking tanks.

They aren’t motivated by patriotism, unit loyalty, honor or sense of duty. It takes a brutal, unsympathetic taskmaster to crack the whip them into fighting shape and Big Boa is the man for this task. His voice booms, he has fists the size of mallets and the demeanor of an angry bear.</li></ul><h4>Cobra Command Infantry Force</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/cobra-officer/4005-11026/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11026\"><b>Cobra Officers</b></a> – Cobra Officers, officers in name only, are front-line fighters who lead Cobra attack units into battle. They are all martial arts experts, masters of disguise and demolitions specialists. Many of them double as spies at military defense plants, nuclear power facilities, etc.</li><li><a href=\"/claw/4055-56217/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56217\"><b>C</b><b>.L.A.W.S.</b></a> – The CLAWS (Combat Light Armored Weapons Specialist) are the newer elite troops of the Cobra organization. They are lightly armored heavy weapons specialists that can take a long of punishment and dish out even more. They utilize a new lightweight, ionized fiber armor which was developed from stolen U.S. Army technology. They can move quickly and take out large targets and vehicles. Many of them also pilot the <a href=\"/fang/4055-56222/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56222\">Cobra Fang 3</a> and the Venom Striker.</li><li><b>Desert C.</b><b>L.A.W.S.</b> – The Desert CLAWS are like the regular CLAWS, except they also have added technology to help them survive the hottest, driest parts of the world. They armor has the added function of heat-deflection insulation and a body cooling system.</li><li><b><a href=\"/cobra-soldiers/4060-57947/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57947\">Cobra Troopers</a> –</b> These are the very basic, bottom of the totem pole soldiers in the Cobra forces. This is where almost every Cobra soldier starts out. The number of new recruits per year is massive, reaching into the tens of thousands. They go through a very basic training and are provided with their uniform and gear and then grouped up into reasonably cohesive teams.</li><li><a href=\"/cyber-viper/4005-66851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66851\"><b>Cyber Vipers</b></a> – Cyber-Vipers have bio cybernetic implants, designed by Dr. Mindbender, which allow them to interface with computerized systems like the extremely advanced Cobra Deviant Mobile Mech Suit. This allows them to operate the suit as an extension of their own body. They are also the commanders of the Mega-Monsters and keep them under control.</li><li><b>Desert Scorpion</b> – Desert Scorpions are not a volunteer position, it is a punishment handed to a Viper that refuses to follow orders. To survive they must quickly adapt to the attack patterns of the venomous desert scorpions with which they live. They get a re-evaluation after a year and if their record is unblemished they will be reinstated to their previous rank. They fight hard because they know if they don’t they will be forced into the Toxo-Vipers, the Cobra Hostile Environment Detachment.</li><li><b>Fast Blast Vipers</b> – Fast Blast Vipers are deployed to lead attacks with destroying G.I. Joe as their objective. They are armed with specially designed battlefield bazooka, and have a computer chip implanted into their brain to neutralize any fear-like emotions and enhance their aggression.</li><li><b>Flak-Vipers</b> – The Flak-Viper is a portable anti-aircraft artillery weapons specialist. Their helmets have a passive infrared targeting and sighting system, and the Flak-Viper has exceptional natural hand-eye coordination and the skills to concentrate on multiple targets simultaneously. Flak-Vipers train daily to maintain their effectiveness which allows them to fire extremely accurate missiles at enemy aircraft with absolute impunity.</li><li><a href=\"/frag-viper/4005-63615/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63615\"><b>Frag-Vipers</b></a> – The Frag-Viper is an important part of the Cobra Viper team. They are trained to toss high-explosive fragmentation grenades, at a pace of 15 rounds per minute, with the range and accuracy of Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers, but without the noise and added hassle of the launcher itself. They were insect looking goggles which contain electo-optical image-intensifiers that provide both infrared and night vision capabilities. Their helmet has a built in range-finder and automatically varies the fuse time on the grenades to accommodate each designated target.</li><li><a href=\"/heat-viper/4005-63616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63616\"><b>H.E.A.T. Vipers</b></a> – HEAT (High Explosive Anti-Tank) Viper specialist are equipped with the latest in hyper-kinetic, high-speed, wire-guided, armor-piercing technology. The sighting system is fiber-optically connected to the helmet, which computes range-finding, trajectory and image acquisition. This allows the HEAT Viper to fire their weapon from behind the protection of cover and in adverse weather conditions.</li><li><b>Incinerators</b> – Incinerators are exactly what they sound like; they are flame-weapon and arson specialists. They are equipped with state-of-the-art fluorocarbon propellant flame projectors which shoot out burning streams of jellied gasoline. They are completed covered from head toe in fire-resistant, air-conditioned fighting suit.</li><li><a href=\"/laser-viper/4005-66855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66855\"><b>Laser Vipers</b></a> – Laser Viper troopers’ primary function is “target illumination” targeting for other Cobra Viper units. The Cobra Laser Viper places his beam on a target then squeezes off a laser-guided anti-tank missile that uses the beam to locate its target. This beam also works the same way for many of the other Viper troops.</li><li><b>Mega-Vipers</b> – Mega-Vipers are the spearhead of the Cobra Mega-Monsters, and they go right into the thick of battles with the Monsters. Commands for the Monsters are issued by Dr. Mindbender or Cyber-Vipers, but it’s the skilled tactics of the Mega-Vipers who train and lead the Monsters on their attack missions.</li><li><b>Monstro-Vipers</b> – Monstro-Vipers were once members of the Cobra Range Vipers, until Cobra Commander demanded they “volunteer” for an experiment in DNA alteration. The experiment was run by Dr. Mindbender who crossed the Vipers with the bio-genetics of rapid werewolves, giant “Bigfoot” creatures, and the most vicious grizzly bears. The fusion process leaves them ¼ man and ¾ beast, the most brutal beasts to ever roam the earth.</li><li><b>Neo Viper Commander</b> – He is the leader of the Neo-Viper forces, the troops that make up the backbone of the Cobra legions. Extremely mean, unquestionably loyal and willing to backstab anyone it takes to get ahead, he trains the Neo-Vipers in all forms of combat and has them ready to deploy immediately when needed. He is outfitted with techno-engineering to withstand all types of severe weather elements, same as all Neo-Viper troops.</li><li><a href=\"/neo-vipers/4005-7721/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7721\"><b>Neo Vipers</b></a> – Neo-Vipers are cold-blooded commandos whose mental states have been enhanced to change them into superhuman warriors. They are suited up in armored climate-controlled outfit, which allows them to function in extreme environments. They train in deep battle tactics, survival procedures, and high-tech weapon-systems management. They are aggressive, ferocious, sneaky, yet practical enough to know when to retreat tactically.</li><li><a href=\"/night-viper/4005-63617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63617\"><b>Night Vipers</b></a> – Night Viper troops wear specialized gear for nighttime operations, such as a helmet that is a miracle of electronics-miniaturization. Their helmets have a wide-angle image intensifier, directional sound amplifier and passive infrared detector, assisting them in quickly locating enemies via sight and sound with immaculate accuracy. They wear customized synthetic composite suits to conceal them from radar and they are skilled and trained in perpetually dark environments.</li><li><a href=\"/saw-viper/4005-63653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63653\"><b>S.A.W. Vipers</b></a> – The Cobra SAW Viper soldier is equipped with a gyro-stabilized, cryogenically cooled mini-chain gun with infrared night-vision auto-ranging optical sighting system. This means they have a highly accurate, low malfunctioning machine gun that can tear apart a target in heavy brush over 800 yards away in pitch black darkness.</li><li><a href=\"/sludge-viper/4005-66859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66859\"><b>Sludge Viper</b></a> – The Sludge Viper never runs out of ammo, since his sludge gun has a built in decomposition accelerator which can create more toxic sludge out of whatever is readily available. The sludge gun propels the toxic sludge at lethal velocities with noxious methane gases. The gun also features a laser range finder, 3 gen image intensifier and phased magnetic array, sludge guidance system.</li><li><a href=\"/techno-viper/4005-12210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12210\"><b>Techno-Vipers</b></a> – Techno Vipers are Cobras battlefield technicians. It is inevitable that the vehicles and machines used in these modern battles will break down and when they do it is the mission of the Techno-Vipers to provide field maintenance support and combat-engineer capability to the frontline Cobra troops. They maintain and operate Cobra Power Fighter units on the battlefield so they can help with the battle while out in the field until they are needed for technician duties.</li><li><a href=\"/tele-viper/4005-7754/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7754\"><b>Tele-Vipers</b></a> – Tele-Vipers are the communications gurus of the Cobra organization. Their understanding of communications equipment and protocols covers all conveyance technology from SatCom to VHF and they relay information and conduct ultra-sensitive surveillance and espionage.</li><li><a href=\"/toxo-viper/4005-63612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63612\"><b>Toxo-Vipers</b></a> – Originally the Toxo-Vipers were referred to as the “Leaky Suit Brigade”, and assignment to them was considered severe punishment. While the new Toxo-Vipers sport top quality state-of-the-art equipment, which greatly increases their survival ratio, it is still considered a punishment as they have to deal with intensely toxic sludge.</li><li><b>Toxo-Zombies</b> – Toxo-Zombies are the result of Toxo-Vipers who suffered prolonged constant exposure to the worst chemical wastes. The radioactive byproducts and toxic sludge have mutated them into vile deformed zombies. They are not really alive, but not dead either, somewhere in-between.</li><li><a href=\"/vipers/4005-7753/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7753\"><b>Vipers</b></a> – Cobra Viper commandos carry out extremely dangerous and deadly missions. They attack convoys and other military patrols. They are supported by advanced vehicles and weapons which they use to ruthlessly bombard their targets. They wear multi-layered body armor and wrap around helmets with built-in communication gear. They also carry multi-burst laser pistols, commando rifles and grenade launchers.</li></ul><h4>Cobra Command Air Force Commander</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/wild-weasel/4005-11047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11047\"><b>Wild Weasel</b></a> – Wild Weasel learned his flying skills while running Cobra operations in every hemisphere in the world. He has extensive knowledge of close support aircraft ranging from jury-rigged civilian conversions to state-of-the-art flying weapons platforms. His main battlefield strategy is to swoop in with his <a href=\"/cobra-rattler/4055-55993/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55993\">Cobra Rattler</a> and take out enemy armored vehicles to reduce the opposition for Cobra ground forces. When he gets into the cockpit of the Night Adder he goes looking for trouble just so he can open fire with the side guns and launch of massive array of missiles at any G.I. Joe aircraft unlucky enough to invade his airspace.</li></ul><h4>Cobra Command Air Force</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/aero-viper/4005-63613/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63613\"><b>Aero-Vipers</b></a> – Aero-Vipers are not surgically or bio-organically altered like Strato-Vipers and Star-Vipers; they lift weights and learn to take the pressure from g-forces and hard aircraft maneuvers. In the 90’s they piloted the then advanced technology <a href=\"/cobra-condor-z-25/4055-56004/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56004\">Cobra Condor Z-25</a> which had forward swept wings and computer driven servo-actuators which allowed it to perform a turning radius roughly half that of an F-16. Currently they are combat and reconnaissance pilots that are trained in stealth and evasion tactics to conduct clandestine operations using the most advanced stealth jets, the Crimson Hydra.</li><li><b>Air Devils</b> – Air Devils are front-line stealth assault air commandos that are highly trained in unorthodox combat styles and dirty fighting. They use <a href=\"/cobra-viper-hangglider/4055-56246/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56246\">Cobra Gliders</a> to silently fly past enemy defenses to penetrate deep behind the lines to wreak havoc from within. They are lightly armed due to weight restrictions, but they can procure heavier weapons and ammunition from enemy forces they sneak up on and overtake.</li><li><b><a href=\"/astro-viper/4005-63607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63607\">Astro-Vipers</a></b> – Astro-Vipers are Cobranauts whose mission is to maintain and repair satellite surveillance technology. Astro-Vipers are the only ones qualified besides TARGATS for duty in the voids of space. As Cobra’s network of “eyes-in-the-sky” grows, so does the demand for more technicians capable of being Cobranauts, whom need to be able to withstand repeated high-G launching and extensive tours of duty in orbit. They are recruited from the ranks of the Strato-Vipers.</li><li><a href=\"/avac/4005-63599/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63599\"><b>A.V.A.C.</b></a> – The AVAC (Air Viper, Advanced Class) is a <a href=\"/cobra-firebat/4055-55995/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55995\">Cobra Firebat Jet</a> pilot who has been specially trained and has exceptional pilot and navigation skills. They need these skills as the Firebat has minimal pilot instrumentation. Piloting a Firebat has been described as strapping yourself onto a cannonball, as it is vertically launched for takeoff and only contains a basic flight panel, throttle, pedals and stick, no navigation and no ejection seat.</li><li><b><a href=\"/blackstar/4005-63674/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63674\">Blackstars</a></b> – Cobra Commander has formed an alliance with a secretive legion of space pilots called Blackstar. Their origin is unknown, but they are the best at what they do. They have incredible agility in zero-gravity environments and can engage in stellar dogfights. As no one has ever seen a Blackstar up close, there are questions as to whether or not they are even human.</li><li><b><a href=\"/gyro-viper/4005-63601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63601\">Gyro-Vipers</a></b> – Gyro-Vipers are the pilots of the <a href=\"/cobra-mamba/4055-55999/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55999\">Cobra Mamba</a> which are smaller, faster attack helicopters with very little armor. Gyro-Vipers are fast, decisive thinkers with even quicker reactions. They describe helicopter flying as operating a yo-yo with your left hand while spinning a pie plate on the tip of your right index finger while you balance full glasses of water on top of both feet. Now piloting an attack helicopter is like doing all that while riding a 12 point buck through the woods during hunting season.</li><li><b><a href=\"/night-vulture/4005-63658/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63658\">Night Vultures</a></b> – Night Vultures are like Air Devils, they use Cobra Gliders to insert themselves covertly and conduct recon missions. As part of their training, they are dropped from a transport miles from land over shark-infested waters. Those who make it back earn the Night Vulture badge and earn the right to keep the personal effects of those who “drop-out.”</li><li><b><a href=\"/sky-creeper/4005-63659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63659\">Sky Creeper</a></b> – Sky Creeper created his first glider out of bed sheets and broom sticks and used it to successfully escape reform school. His criminal career consists of robbing fancy rooftop restaurant patrons and then escaping by jumping off and gliding off into the darkness. Sky Creeper was recruited by one of the Dreadnoks during a prison stint, he formed the Night Vultures, which he commands.</li><li><b><a href=\"/star-viper/4005-63611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63611\">Star-Vipers</a></b> – A Star-Viper is a qualified Cobra Strato-Viper with an electro-magnetic shunt implanted into the brain which stimulates the reflexes while heightening awareness for split second decisions. This is necessary during the high-speed, upper-atmospheric dog fights they take part in. Early on they piloted the Cobra Stellar Stiletto, which could fly at Mach speeds and was equipped with laser guns and deep space missiles. Currently they fly the Sand Serpent which is an experimental aircraft designed by M.A.R.S. Industries; and employs stealth technology so it can bombard aerial and ground forces.</li><li><b><a href=\"/strato-viper/4005-11040/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11040\">Strato-Vipers</a></b> – The Strato-Vipers are the “crème de la crème” of the Air-Vipers. A Strato-Viper candidate must have 1,500 hours of flight time logged, a fixed wing rating of at least 4 engines, combat experience and an impeccable security clearance. They must also be willing to undergo a surgical enhancement that makes them resistant to hypoxia, hyperventilation and other decompression illnesses that affect pilots above 63,000 feet. They pilot the fast and stealthy <a href=\"/cobra-night-raven/4055-55997/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55997\">Cobra Night Raven</a>.</li><li><b>Vapor</b> – Vapor is an unbeatable sky warrior who pilots the <a href=\"/hurricane/4055-56226/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56226\">Cobra Hurricane VTOL</a> tactical fighter. He has direct shunts from his optic nerve to his inboard targeting computers. All data is projected to his helmet’s field of vision screen. He also utilizes an advanced laser-powered, heads-up-display target locator which can control and fire the weapons by simple voice commands.</li></ul><h4>Others</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/kwinn/4005-11079/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11079\"><b>Kwinn</b></a> - An Inuit mercenary who only appeared in the first year of the comic book. A mercenary with a strong code of honor, he had previously worked for the CIA, Mossad, MI6, and the KGB, and worked with Cobra in Sierra Gordo. He would later renounce his life as a mercenary, only to be betrayed and killed by Dr. Venom. A hidden grenade then slays Venom.</li><li><a href=\"/blackout/4005-49579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49579\"><b>Blackout</b></a> - Sniper Thomas J. Stall was rejected by G.I. Joe for failing his psychological exam and was suspected of being involved with the disappearance of his sister. After being imprisoned, Thomas broke out of a brig at Fort Huachuca during an attack by Cobra, to whom he surrendered willingly and subsequently joined.</li></ul><h3>Bases</h3><p>Cobra’s primary base is Cobra Island. Cobra is said to have bases, underground cells and even whole communities scattered across the globe. Following are several specific locations with names:</p><ul><li><b>Springfield</b> - A small anonymous U.S. town was the first entirely Cobra controlled town, which Cobra secretly operated as a base. Cobra stored a lot of equipment and vehicles there; many home garages had military vehicles such as tanks inside. Many covert operations were held there, including the creation of Serpentor, which in turn directly led to the town's population being evacuated to Cobra Island after <a href=\"/gi-joe-a-real-american-hero-the-battle-of-springfield/4000-76204/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-76204\">the Battle for Springfield</a>, took place.</li><li><a href=\"/broca-beach-new-jersey/4020-56486/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56486\"><b>Broca Beach, New Jersey</b></a> – Broca is an anagram of Cobra. After Springfield, Cobra overtook another town as their secret base of operations in America. This one was transformed from an abandoned seaside town and was run by the Dreadnoks with the help of multiple Cobra operatives. The displaced residents of the destroyed Springfield town were relocated here.</li><li><b>Delhi Hills</b> – After a rough mission campaign, G.I. Joes <a href=\"/rock-roll/4005-41764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41764\">Rock’N’Roll</a>, <a href=\"/alpine/4005-11085/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11085\">Alpine</a>, <a href=\"/bazooka/4005-11087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11087\">Bazooka</a> and <a href=\"/mutt/4005-11053/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11053\">Mutt</a> meet up for a little R&amp;R at a small town bar. They later discover that the bar and the whole town are inhabited by Cobra affiliates. They get captured, later escape, and by time they return with reinforcements all evidence Cobra was there has been eliminated.</li><li><b>Castle Destro</b> - Destro's fortress in <a href=\"/scotland/4020-55911/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55911\">Scotland</a>. Training ground for the Iron Grenadiers. During a feud between Destro and Cobra Commander it was destroyed by Cobra Commander, and a new castle was presumably reconstructed some years later.</li><li><b>Cobra Citadel</b> also known as the <a href=\"/silent-castle/4020-56495/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56495\"><b>Silent Castle</b></a> - Cobra's base of operations in the Balkan regions, located in Trans-Carpathia. Owned primarily by Destro, he incorporated many secret passageways and features into the castle's architecture including the ability to shift its configuration (through a complex series of levels, pulleys, and gears) into a near-exact likeness of Castle Destro - both internally and externally. Cobra Commander initially gave up the rights to the castle to Destro, but he later decided he wanted it back as it was rather close to his operations in Darklonia.</li><li><b>Cobra Consulate</b> - A towering high-rise in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a> used by Cobra as an embassy and base of operations after Cobra Island was declared a sovereign nation. Its top levels were destroyed in a battle with G.I. Joe, and the building was abandoned by Cobra for some time (save for a few late-night top-secret meetings).</li><li><a href=\"/cobra-island/4020-56485/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56485\"><b>Cobra Island</b></a> - The primary base of Cobra operations located somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. It was created after a massive man-made earthquake. Cobra lawyers, well-prepared, moved in and had it legally declared a sovereign nation. It was the battlefield for the Cobra Civil War, and the battle against Serpentor and ' <a href=\"/the-coil/4005-7741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7741\">the Coil</a>'. After Cobra abandoned it for several years, the island was seized by the U.N. It then came under the control of the Coil, then Cobra, and was finally destroyed by a nuclear warhead, which also killed every member of the Coil.</li><li><a href=\"/millville/4020-56189/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56189\"><b>Millville</b></a> – An industrial-heavy steel town that fell into economic ruin after the closing of the local plant. When Cobra descends literally invading them <a href=\"/gi-joe-a-real-american-hero-seeds-of-empire/4000-133227/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-133227\">one day</a>, the residents are immediately subjugated to a brainwashing device, leading to the formation of a local resistance with the help of Mutt and <a href=\"/spirit/4005-12192/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12192\">Spirit</a>.</li><li><b>Monolith Base</b> - A massive mountain complex located in Badhikistan. It served as Cobra's main base after Cobra Island was taken over by Serpentor and his Coil forces.</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animated Television Series</h3><p> </p><h3>Film</h3><p> </p>",

Originally Zemo was a major threat during World War II and was the second most feared man throughout the Nazi regime, standing only one foot away from the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> himself. Much like Red Skull, Zemo would also become a major threat for Captain America and <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a>. His hatred for the American hero would increase when his face was merged to the hooded mask that he was wearing during a fight against Captain America. Because of this incident, Zemo had long obsessed over the death of Captain America and was willing to cheat the Red Skull from doing it himself. After World War II was coming to an end and Red Skull was believed to have died, Zemo later lured both Captain America and Bucky into a trap that nearly killed both heroes. Believing that his nemesis and his annoying sidekick was finally dead, Zemo was unaware that both heroes managed to survive as Captain America accidentally went into suspended animation within arctic waters while Bucky was found by the communist Russians who brainwashed him into becoming their own assassin.</p><p>Zemo found himself avoiding capture for his war crimes after the war ended and relocated as a ruler in a South American tribe where he created his own private kingdom. After years of living in seclusion, Zemo would finally be shocked to learn of Captain America’s actual return and found himself dedicated to ensure that Captain America’s death would be more ensured once and for all.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800922\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.93207547169811\" data-width=\"265\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 265px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800922\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" data-width=\"265\"></a></figure><p>Zemo knew that Captain America’s newest allies, the Avengers would prove to be a threat against Captain America’s death, which forced him to take an alternate method to take on the his old enemy. Studying each member of the Avengers, Zemo carefully formed his own incarnation of villains that was comparable to the Avengers and with each member who individually posed a major threat towards a certain member of the Avengers. Recruiting villains like the <a href=\"/melter/4005-7260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7260\">Melter</a> who once was a serious threat for <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, the criminal scientist known as <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-3172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3172\">Black Knight</a> who tangled with both <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant Man</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>, and <a href=\"/radioactive-man/4005-4807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4807\">Radioactive Man</a> who was a threat for the Mighty <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> himself. With each villain promised his rightful vengeance by strength in numbers, secretly Zemo dubbed this team as the Masters of Evil. Even though each member served together for their promised opportunity for revenge, Zemo cared less for the motives of his team seeing how the main goal of the Masters of Evil was to ensure that there would be no obstacles that stood in his way when killing Captain America once and for all.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Masters of Evil were created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1964 and first appeared in <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\">The Avengers</a> #6.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-399234\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-399234\"><img alt=\"1st Masters of Evil\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"1st Masters of Evil\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>1st Masters of Evil</figcaption></figure><p>Baron Zemo and his Masters of Evil decided that the best approach against the Avengers was to draw the heroes into battle. Zemo and his team did so when he attacked <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a> with his <a href=\"/adhesive-x/4055-56748/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56748\">Adhesive X</a>, a substance that was proclaimed to have no solution. With a majority of the population trapped by Zemo’s attack, the responding Avengers would find themselves unprepared against Zemo and the Masters of Evil because of the Adhesive X they were using. Capturing <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Giant Man</a> and Captain America, the remaining Avengers was forced into fleeing and finds a way to fight against the Masters of Evil and the Adhesive X. Much like Zemo, Captain America was shocked to learn of Zemo was still alive and the hero wanted revenge for death of his partner Bucky. Elsewhere the Avengers located the <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a>, a villain who specializes in adhesive for a solution to Zemo’s Adhesive X.</p><p>With the help of Trapster because of wanting a lighter sentence for his prison term, the Avengers would secretly replace Zemo’s Adhesive X canisters with solvent and manage to trick the Masters of Evil into dissolving the Adhesive X. This led to all but one of the Masters of Evil to face defeat and incarceration while Zemo escaped with no army at his side for his personal quest to kill Captain America.</p><h3>Darkest Hour</h3><p>With Zemo left with no army, no hopes with accomplishing his task on killing Captain America, and that a desperate Captain America was on his trail for murdering his partner Bucky, Zemo would finally catch another opportunity with the Avengers when encountering <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a> and the <a href=\"/executioner/4005-3517/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3517\">Executioner</a> who were both recently exiled from <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> for their crimes against Thor. As both Asgardians joined Zemo and recreated a shorter version of the Masters of Evil, Zemo had Enchantress mystically force Thor into fighting against his own teammates. Nearly managing on destroying the Avengers, the arrival of Iron Man would release Thor from his hypnotic trance, which followed the God of Thunder individually sending the Masters of Evil into another dimension.</p><h3>Wonder Man</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851639\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5422993492408\" data-width=\"461\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 461px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851639\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 461w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 461w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Enchantress managed to use her magic abilities to escape the dimension, Zemo decided that his next attack against the Avengers is by attacking them from within. By doing this, Zemo needed to recruit another member into the Masters of Evil and somebody who could easily pose as a hero. Deciding that the best way to do this is by also using his technology to grant ionic powers and to ensure absolute loyalty. Zemo would find a possible candidate for his goals within <a href=\"/hollywood/4005-25860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25860\">Simon Williams</a>, who was recently fired for embezzlement. Blindly accepting Zemo’s offer for freedom from his prison stint and gaining powers, Zemo turned Willaims into an ionic-powered being dubbed <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>. Following through with Zemo’s plan by finding acceptance within the Avengers because of his heroic actions, Zemo would cue Wonder Man the precise moment to betray the Avengers and finally rid the heroes and Captain America once and for all.</p><p>To ensure full loyalty from Williams, Zemo also advise Willaims that his powers are temporary and that his body would need a periodically serum dosage to stabilize his ionic physiology. However Wonder Man would change his idea of luring the Avengers into Zemo’s trap and sacrificed himself to save his teammates from Zemo and the Masters of Evil.</p><h3>The Time Traveling Immortus</h3><p>Zemo and the Masters of Evil would later be approached by the time traveling Immortus who offered his assistance on defeating the Avengers. With Immortus sending Space Phantoms disguised as historical figures of the past to attack the Avengers, he also managed to send Captain America back to 1760 London. With Captain America gone, the Masters of Evil made their attack against the Avengers and nearly succeeded on defeating them until Immortus returned Captain America to his rightful place in time because of how he was impressed with his display of heroism.</p><p>With the Masters of Evil facing another defeat, Enchantress managed to restore time to before Zemo was approached by <a href=\"/immortus/4005-7215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7215\">Immortus</a>. Even though time was restored within Reality-616, another reality known as Reality-64110 continues on with the fight and capture of the Masters of Evil.</p><h3>The Final Assault</h3><p>After his repeated and unsuccessful attempts, Zemo became desperate with Captain America’s demise and decided to rebuild his Masters of Evil to directly attack the Avengers and find a way to lure Captain America away from the team and take on the hero himself. Managing to have Melter and Black Knight escape from their prison term, Baron Zemo was unable to have Radioactive Man rejoin his group because of him being deported to <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\">China</a> after his recent capture.</p><p>Still having an equal group compared to the Avengers, Zemo next kidnapped Rick Jones and took him to his secluded base in <a href=\"/south-america/4020-56960/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56960\">South America</a> as a way to lure Captain America to Zemo. As the Masters of Evil launched a full-scale attack on the Avengers, Captain America followed Zemo’s trail to his base and found himself battling Zemo and his hired men. As Zemo attempted to use his Death Ray against the Avenger, Captain America reflected the attack and caused Zemo to be blinded. Blinded and angered, Zemo shot his pistol wildly, which caused a landslide to crush and kill Baron Zemo. With Zemo dead, the remaining Masters of Evil didn’t fare any better, as all members were defeated and captured besides Enchantress and the Executioner who managed to escape.</p><p>With one of the teams greatest threats finally coming to an end, Captain America would personally bury Zemo’s body, as he would be convinced that Bucky’s death was finally avenged.</p><h3>The Mysterious Crimson Cowl</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-97587\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.996\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-97587\"><img alt=\"2nd Masters of Evil\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"2nd Masters of Evil\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>2nd Masters of Evil</figcaption></figure><p>Secretly acting indirectly and strictly behind the scenes, the psychotic robot known as <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> plan his attacks on the Avengers for the purposes of ruining his creator, Hank Pym. Adopting a criminal disguise as the <a href=\"/crimson-cowl/4005-22613/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22613\">Crimson Cowl</a>, Ultron would recruit Radioactive Man, Melter, <a href=\"/klaw/4005-3171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3171\">Klaw</a>, <a href=\"/whirlwind/4005-6828/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6828\">Whirlwind</a>, and a new Black Knight who was the nephew of the original Black Knight who recently died from injuries after a battle with Iron Man. To make his true disguise and agenda more hidden, Ultron dubbed and recreated the team as the Masters of Evil. Managing to kidnap <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Edwin Jarvis</a>, who was the butler for the Avengers, Ultron would hypnotize Jarvis into taking the disguise of the Crimson Cowl to further avoid his involvement or suspicion. Not only did Ultron frame Jarvis for his crimes as the Crimson Cowl, but also used him to gain information on the Avengers security systems and how to easily gain access into the <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">mansion</a>. With this knowledge, Ultron guided his Masters of Evil into defeating and capturing the Avengers.</p><p>With the Avengers captured, Ultron next directed his attention against New York City. Eventually members within the Masters began to disagree with their leaders goals, which caused Klaw into attacking him after being berated. Simply shrugging off Klaw's attack, Ultrons identity was finally discovered before Black Knight freed the Avengers and managed to defeat the criminal group after Ultron made his escape. With the Masters defeated, Black Knight would reveal himself to the Avengers as a hero who was following his uncles dying wish of not following the same footsteps as he did and decided to restore heroism to the Black Knight name by single handily defeating the reincarnated Masters of Evil.</p><p>Even though Ultron decided to move on without the assistance of any humans, this version of the Masters of Evil still continued to work together as they made another attempt against the Avengers. Yet, this version would prove less successful as they faced another quick defeat, which caused the Masters of Evil to part ways.</p><h3>Egghead's Ultimate Revenge</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081437\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70894677236693\" data-width=\"1766\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1766px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081437\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 1766w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 1766w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A third Masters of Evil would be created when the criminal scientist known as <a href=\"/egghead/4005-3797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3797\">Egghead</a> sought assistance with his plot for gaining revenge against Hank Pym and manipulating him into serving him. What was supposed to be the ultimate plan against Pym who recently was shunned from the Avengers, Egghead broke Whirlwind, <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a>, and <a href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Moonstone</a> out of form his own criminal group. However Egghead's plan would find itself quickly threatened when Whirlwind anticipated his attack on the Avengers by trying to gain revenge against the Wasp for his prior defeats. Forcing the remaining Masters to attack the unsuspecting Avengers, the criminal group found itself easily bested by the Avengers and sent back to prison. However Egghead was far from giving up on needing a group and decided to free Tiger Shark and Moonstone, but replaced Whirlwind and Scorpion with the <a href=\"/abe-jenkins/4005-4822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4822\">Beetle</a>, <a href=\"/shocker/4005-4825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4825\">Shocker</a>, and Radioactive Man.</p><p>After remaking the roster, Egghead sent the group to kidnap Pym from court and make it look like Pym was working with the Masters so that he could increase the damage on Pym’s reputation as a hero. Coercing Pym into creating a longevity serum, Egghead was unaware that Pym was secretly creating a device to use against him and that the Avengers have managed to locate Eggheads secret hideout. But before the Avengers arrived on the scene to rescue Pym, they found that Pym managed to single-handily defeat Egghead and all the Masters of Evil with the device that he made.</p><p>With the Avengers arriving and seeing the victorious Pym standing over the defeated Masters, Egghead made one last attempt against Pym by trying to shoot him in the back with a pistol.

Baron Heinrich Zemo not only took up his father’s mantle as a criminal mastermind, but also followed his father’s very same footsteps by attempting to destroy Captain America and the Avengers. This time Zemo decided to take more calculating steps on bringing the Avengers to their knee’s by forming not only a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but also a massive army that consisted of the most dangerous and deadliest foes who individually posed a threat for the Avengers. Zemo’s army mostly consisted of villains that had brute strength and such as <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"/mr-hyde/4005-3233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3233\">Mr. Hyde</a>, the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/4060-18519/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18519\">Wrecking Crew</a>, <a href=\"/absorbing-man/4005-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1779\">Absorbing Man</a>, and <a href=\"/titania/4005-4943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\">Titania</a>. Some members were specifically important for Zemo such as <a href=\"/blackout/4005-41820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41820\">Blackout</a> who displayed powers of manipulating the dark force and Moonstone who was the only one that could control him and his actions. Even though Moonstone did pose a threat against Zemo’s leadership, he still kept her at a close distance and hid the fact that he had <a href=\"/fixer/4005-3282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3282\">Fixer</a> implant commands in Blackout’s mind that could make him control Blackout if ever needed too.</p><p>Aside from Moonstone and Blackout, Fixer also assisted Zemo for his abnormal mechanical skills that also proved very useful for Zemo. Prior to his attack on the Avengers, Zemo sent a few villains such Yellow Jacket, Absorbing Man, and Titania to find possible recruits to help him and the Masters of Evil storm the Avengers Mansion. Yet these attempts proved unsuccessful and ended with <a href=\"/grey-gargoyle/4005-6816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6816\">Grey Gargoyle</a> and <a href=\"/songbird/4005-3281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3281\">Screaming Mimi</a> being arrested, also a meddling <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> managed to defeat both Absorbing Man and Titania while trying to recruit <a href=\"/mongoose/4005-25662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25662\">Mongoose</a>. During this time, Zemo amused himself by sending both Whirlwind and Trapster to attack Captain America for initiation within his group. Knowing that both villains would fail, Zemo specifically sent Whirlwind on this mission because of his prior incident with the former Masters group that caused their defeat and could be a threat for his plans.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2422512\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3163064833006\" data-width=\"509\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 509px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2422512\"><img alt=\"Avengers (1963) #277\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" data-width=\"486\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 509w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 486w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers (1963) #277\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 509w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" data-width=\"486\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers (1963) #277</figcaption></figure><p>With Thor, who was one of the Avengers most powerful members being absent, Zemo waited for the exact opportunity to strike and did so when seeing most of the Avengers away from the building. Zemo and his army of super-villains not only managed to successfully infiltrate the mansion, but also captured Captain America, Black Knight, and Jarvis, also using Blackout to send <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a> into the <a href=\"/darkforce/4015-41411/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41411\">Darkforce</a>, and nearly beating <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> to death. With the mansion completely taken over by Zemo and the Masters, Zemo used Blackout to shield the entire mansion with his Darkforce powers so that nobody would be able to enter or leave the mansion. With Hercules hospitalized, Zemo sent both Titania and Absorbing Man to ensure that his death was fulfilled, but this attempt found itself failing as both Ant-Man (<a href=\"/scott-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a>) and Wasp managed to prevent both Masters from killing Hercules. With Captain America captured and taunted by Zemo, the Avenger found himself forced into watching Jarvis being tortured and beaten by Mr. Hyde. With the destruction of the Avengers almost complete, the arrival of Thor and the remaining Avengers proved successful on defeating most of the Masters as they managed to penetrate into the mansion.</p><p>As Thor and arriving Avengers, Zemo were defeating most of the Masters retreated to the roof with Blackout as the released Captain America pursued against him. Zemo would also find himself unable to use Blackout with the implanted commands because of <a href=\"/doctor-druid/4005-10302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10302\">Dr. Druid</a> who was mentally guiding Blackout to retaliate against Zemo; this resulted with Blackout dying from a brain hemorrhage. With the Masters facing defeat and the Avengers building being nearly destroyed, Zemo made his attempt on fighting against Captain America only to find himself falling to his seemingly death. Believing to be dead, Zemo managed to survive the fall and hid underground to rethink his plans against Captain America while the Avengers found themselves reorganizing and rebuilding the damages from Zemo’s attack.</p><h3>The Raid of Dr Octopus</h3><p>With a new cosmic threat arising known as <a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a>, this forced most of the well-known heroic teams to fight against on their attempts to save reality. After noticing the heroes taking absence, <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Dr Octopus</a> decided that the time was right to raid the Avengers Mansion and steal any scientific equipment that would prove useful for research. Possibly influenced by Zemo’s prior attack on the Avengers, Dr Octopus made his attempt to follow the same footsteps by forming his own Masters of Evil to help him raid the mansion and handle any possible threats that they may encounter.</p><p>Even though Dr Octopus made his attempt to follow Zemo’s same footsteps, his greatest flaw was his selection for the Masters, which half of the villains found themselves instantly defeated by the Avengers staff and the arriving <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Despite Dr Octopus and a few Masters being capable of handling themselves against the Guardians, their encounter was interrupted by evil doppelgangers sent by Magus. Forced into forming an alliance with the Guardians, both teams managed to fend off the doppelgangers. Yet Dr. Octopus was still reluctant to raid the mansion and found that his remaining team opposed him. With the Masters of Evil defeated and departed, Dr. Octopus was forced to flee as well one of the opposing Masters known as <a href=\"/rita-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\">Yellowjacket</a> found herself joining the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><h3>Justice, Like Lightning</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168580\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5185454545455\" data-width=\"1375\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1375px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168580\"><img alt=\"Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 1375w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 1375w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey</figcaption></figure><p>Returning to his role as leader of the Masters of Evil, Zemo individually recruited each member of his newest formation of the Masters of Evil. It was during this time that the main heroic teams such as the Avengers and <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> perished during <a href=\"/onslaught/4005-13352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13352\">Onslaught</a>'s attack, forced Zemo to take another approach with his reformed Masters. Seeing the absence of Earth's mightiest heroes as an opportunity to have the world under his control, Zemo and his Masters took a unique step on accomplishing this by secretly posing as heroes to gain public trust, trust that would put Zemo and his Masters closer to their goals. With Fixer’s aid, the Masters found themselves re-equipped and taking different names as the entire group made their public appearance as the heroic Thunderbolts. In an ironic twist, Zemo and the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> found themselves fighting another group who called themselves the Masters of Evil who was led by another mysterious Crimson Cowl. Even though Zemo’s plan was proving successful as the Thunderbolts were gaining public trust as heroes, a rising threat towards his goals of world domination began to rise within the group when some of the members began following their heroic counterparts.</p><p>Taking notice as to how some members began to steer away from Zemo’s goals, Zemo pre-planned this by revealing their secret identities to public prior to his attempt for world takeover, forcing them into staying loyal to his plans and goals. As Zemo and the reluctant Thunderbolts managed to take over the world through means of mind control, the group found itself split apart as most of the Thunderbolts found themselves following their heroic identities by going against Zemo and <a href=\"/fixer/4005-3282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3282\">Techno</a>.

Things to a tragic turn when she was outsmarted by Moonstone of the Hawkeye's Thunderbolts who tricked her into thinking she would side with her, while the rest of her teammates defeated the large roster of super villains.</p><p>However, the Crimson Cowl got the better of them when she teleported herself away and replaced herself with <a href=\"/dallas-riordan/4005-4826/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4826\">Dallas Riordan</a> as a way to fooling the Thunderbolts and the super-human community in thinking Riohard and turned traitor, but she was soon freed by the <a href=\"/v-battalion/4060-22646/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22646\">V-battalion</a> who broke out her out of prison.

However, Hawkeye ends up defeating the various members and escaping with Cap in tow. Leading the Shadow Council to finish their Masters of Evil and launch them against the Avengers.</p><p>Max Fury lead over 50 members of his new Masters of Evil to be the heralds of the Abyss, which was revealed to need the Serpent Crown, the Crown of Thorns and the Crown of Wolves to unlock the gateway back to the 616 Universe. However, after joining the crowns together, he was unable to use the powers of the Abyss since he was an artificial being. The Taskmaster, who was fatally wounded dawn the crown and became the herald for the Abyss and used the Masters of Evil and the Secret Avengers to spread the powers of the Abyss to the rest of the planet.</p><p>Venom and Ant-man who were unaffected by the Abyss due to the symbiot's powers and Ant-man being an LMD were able to stop the Abyss by using the symbiote on the Taskmaster and redividing the crowns. In doing so, the Abyss lost it's grip on the possessed Avengers and Masters and the crown was taken by the Secret Avengers and hidden in various pocket universes where they could guard them more closely. The Shadow Council as a result fell apart as both Thorndrake and Steel were killed and Max Fury fled back to the Decedents.</p><h3>Masters of Evil Reunion</h3><p>A very familiar lineup of Masters of Evil would return under the command of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lightmaster/4005-13938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13938\">the Lightmaster</a> in an attempt to steal a Quantum Energy Transporter.

Fighting as a team the Masters came close to gaining the upper hand several times in the fight with Titania and the Absorbing Man destroying a Spider Walker and Blackout managing to interfere with the Superior Spiderman's control of his 'allies'.</p><p>In the end the Masters were temporarily defeated when Sungirl activated the device Lightmaster had stolen causing herself, the Six, Lightmaster and Spiderman to teleport to another location. It can be assumed that after Lightmaster's arrest the rest of the Master's disbanded or were apprehended by local law enforcement.</p><h3>Zemo's Return</h3><p>Baron Zemo would once again take control of the Masters of Evil and attempt to recreate a team worthy of using the title.

The <a href=\"/supreme-intelligence/4005-6096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6096\">Supreme Intelligence</a> forced the Kree into a new form of evolution the Ruul. The Ruul were the main instigators of maximum security.</p><p>The Kree started out as a primitive species sharing their planet <a href=\"/hala/4020-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56002\">Hala</a> with the <a href=\"/cotati/4060-46135/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46135\">Cotati</a>, a race of plantlike humanoids. Their planet was visited by the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a>, whom at the time where a peaceful race. They told the Kree and the Cotati that one of their species would be chosen to represent their planet in an interplanetary counsel. To chose which species it would be; they sent both the Kree and the Cotati to our moon, and told them each to build a city there. The species that built the best one would be chosen to represent the planet. The Kree labored over building a city (what is now the blue area of the moon) while the Cotati slept. When the Skrulls came back to the moon to award a winner they found that the Cotati had grown a huge garden while they slept! The Cotati won the contest. Furious, the Kree killed all of the Cotati and all of the Skrulls that visited their planet. They then used the Skrull ship to go to the Skrull home world and start the Kree-Skrull wars.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1608302\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5164454702827\" data-width=\"1733\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1733px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1608302\"><img alt=\"As told by the Kree\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 1733w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></a><figcaption>As told by the Kree</figcaption></figure><p>The Second Kree-Skull War was started by the Skrulls although the Kree were considering it. The Skrulls were led by <a href=\"/kylor/4005-56638/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56638\">Kylor</a>, one of five claiming to be Emperor of the Skrulls. After capturing a Kree spy on one of their worlds they decided to strike first. When the Supreme Intelligence lost his mind, <a href=\"/nenora/4005-56642/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56642\">Nenora</a> took over as Supreme Leader. Nenora was secretly a Skrull, but choose to remain a Kree and rule over all. She betrayed Kylor and her people. The Skrull campaign was taken over by Empress <a href=\"/sbyll/4005-41667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41667\">S'byll</a> after Kylor's death. Nenora was defeated by S'byll when she gave Nenora her shape-shifting powers back. S'byll announced to the Kree their leader was truly a Skrull and that she had won the war. But, S'byll declared a peace. Tus-Katt was the highest ranking member available and he did not accept a peace, this was against all the Kree stand for. The best he could accept was a truce, which she accepted.</p><p>With the loss of the Supreme Intelligence and Nenora the Kree were left without a leader. Through manipulation, the <a href=\"/contemplator/4005-13988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13988\">Contemplator</a> was able to get the pirate <a href=\"/clumsy-foulup/4005-29131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29131\">Clumsy Foulup</a> to become emperor. The emperor was assassinated by <a href=\"/ael-dan/4005-27760/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27760\">Ael-Dan</a> and <a href=\"/dar-ben/4005-27761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27761\">Dar-Benn</a>. They ruled the empire together, one being of blue skin and one of pink.

The whole Kree/Shi'ar War was orchestrated by the Supreme Intelligence as a way to jump start the Kree's evolutionary dead end, thus the Ruul was born.

Finding the proof of his betrayal, Ronan executes the enemies of the empire and is named leader of the Kree after the mercy killing of the Supreme Intelligence (who had already been lobotomized by the Fiyero).

He is attacked by two Skrulls just before the invasion, his fate is currently unknown.</p><p>Due to the Skrulls having abducted <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a> form an alliance with the Kree in an effort to locate him. Ronan's price for this alliance is the hand of <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a> of the Inhuman Royal Family, a price her sister readily accepts. In the aftermath of the invasion the Inhumans leave the moon and travel to Kree space. They breach the barrier and confront Ronan who relinquishes the throne to <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>During the Inhumans vengeance upon the Skrulls, a group of Shi'ar Warbirds are destroyed. <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Emperor Vulcan</a> takes this as a challenge and sets his sights on conquering the Kree. The second Kree/Shi'ar War begins with the Shi'ar crashing the wedding of Ronan the Accuser and <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>.</p><p>Black Bolt unleashes his weapon known as the T-Bomb, a device made with the Terrigen Mists, in the belief it will make everyone into Inhumans and end the war. With the detonation of the bomb, Black Bolt and Vulcan both perish, and it also creates a rip in space known as the <a href=\"/the-fault/4020-56597/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56597\">Fault</a>. With Black Bolt presumed dead, leadership of the Kree Empire is left to <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a>.</p><h3>War of the Four Cities</h3><p>It would come to be known that the experiment that created the Inhumans was prophesied to be the end of the Supreme Intelligence. Of the 100 races created, the Supreme Intelligence ordered them all destroyed. But five races survived. They would all come together to try and make the Earth their new home. The Inhumans, now lead by Black Bolt who had returned from the dead, left the empire in the hands of Ronan.</p><p>After all houses agreed to have him as leader, he and Crystal left for Earth to take complete control of the Kree Empire once and for all.</p><h2>Genetics</h2><p><u>Reproduction</u></p><p>The Kree people procreate naturally between male and females of the species. Valuing what they consider to be their genetic purity, reproduction outside of the species is strictly prohibited taboo.</p><p>It is considered a punishable crime In the Kree empire for a male non-Kree to impregnate any Kree female. Even though it is possible to produce hybrid offspring between a great many races separate from their native race. Like <a href=\"/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a> of the planet Earth.</p><p><u>Evolution</u></p><p>The Kree, initially rendered progressively stunted due to the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a> punishing their ancestry for attempting to harness the <a href=\"/mkraan-crystal/4055-44426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44426\">M'Kraan Crystal</a> for their own ends much like the Skrulls. Still possessed the latent potential to produce super humanoid beings through preternatural or outside mutation, genetic engineering, or cutting edge cybernetics technology along the evolutionary chain.</p><p>This theory was tested to the most extreme degree by a plan, known only to a few among their number, by the Supreme Intelligence via activating and discharging a Kree <a href=\"/nega-bomb/4055-59347/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-59347\">Nega Bomb</a> in the middle of Kree space. A secret plan disguised as a war induced incursion into their universal sector during <a href=\"/operation-galactic-storm/4045-27758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-27758\">Operation: Galactic Storm</a>, a heated war involving the Shi'ar wherein Earth was caught in the middle as the former attempted to open a stargate channel between the Milky Way galaxy to territories owned by Hala.</p><p>The radioactive fallout of it's explosion.

Thus enabling the them to escape their evolutionary deadlock, allegedly granting them unlimited potential. Other signs of potential evolution stem from the existence of artificial Homo Superior among the Kree race named Tsu-Zana. Whom was created with her own mutant X-Gene in order to overthrow the domination of both <a title=\"Shi'ar (Race)\" href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Shi%27ar_(Race)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shi'ar</a> and blue-skinned Kree, as their savior.</p><p>As with many species across the Marvel Universe, two adjacent cosmic enclaves had performed genetic experiments on the primitive ancestors of the Kree millennia ago. The being the most prolific of whom being the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>, cosmological titans that; as with primordial humanity, had divided the prehistoric Kree between Deviant and Eternal communities. While another less colloquial race of space god called the <a href=\"/progenitors/4060-63313/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-63313\">Progenitors</a>, first introduced the tertiary chain of special existence which the Kree would study profusely for years to come. The first in a long series of genetic regression known as Inhumanity.</p><p>While the record of Kree Eternal/Deviant interaction remains largely undisclosed to current date. The Eternal's were once a thriving community on Hala which eventually dwindled to it's lone purveyor <a href=\"/demon-druid/4005-14892/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14892\">Ultimus</a>, whom would soon find his way to Earth.</p><p>Ard-Con being the last known living Kree Eternal specimen to date.

A few among the Kree bred with other alien species, producing the \"Pink-Skinned\" Kree, a second class citizenry who appear similar to Caucasian earth born humans. Though they outnumber their \"Blue-Skinned\" cousins a hundred to one, they are a suppressed minority whom're often used as slave labor in the empire.</p><p>There is a rare subset of altered Kree whom, via exposure to egentic tempering or unique blends of radiology. Are known to develop superhuman abilities beyond the regular norm of their race. Such individuals include Captain <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Mar-Vell</a>, <a href=\"/captain-atlas/4005-27096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27096\">Att-Lass</a>, <a href=\"/dr-minerva/4005-26673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26673\">Minn-Erva</a> and <a href=\"/commando/4005-9712/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9712\">M'Nell</a>.</p><p>In the event of cohabitation with other species across the universe, certain hybrid species are born from said union.

These kinds of Kree are scarce being incredibly varied due to being so far and in between.</p><p><b>Body Type:</b> Humanoid</p><p><b>Avg Height:</b> Between 5-8ft (1.5 to 2.4 m) tall</p><p><b>Avg Weight</b>: Same or greater than humans</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Two</p><p><b>Hair Color:</b> Varies</p><p><b>Skin Color:</b> Blue - Pink</p><p><b>Fingers:</b> Five (with opposable thumbs)</p><p><b>Toes:</b> Five</p><p><b>Special Adaptations:</b> Greatly augmented strength &amp; toughness.

An imperium ruled by a cosmic uni-mind known as the Supreme Intelligence, it/they are the absolute authority of their entire galaxy spanning civilization.</p><p>A conquistador race where Soldiers and commanders are subservient to the Supremor's Accusers as are the Accusers to the Supreme Intelligence. A civilization built on the concept of expansionism, they're main objective as a superpower is not to make contact but to subjugate and enslave.</p><p>As such, Kree science is considered second to none even by an intergalactic standard. Being many leagues higher than that of Earth. Much of which being devoted to their own evolutionary advancement.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Super-Humanoid Strength: The Kree have adapted to a heavier gravity than the people of Earth, therefore they gain a greater increase in physicals compared to the average adult homo sapiens. Able to lift between 1 and 1.2 metric tons of weight.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Speed: Mar-Vell was considered fast even by Kree standard, possessing a level of speed that would qualify as enhanced for a human.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Stamina: Kree bodily fibers are comparatively more enhanced than those of the finest mammalian specimen. They can push themselves considerably harder and longer under optimal conditions.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Durability: The standard kree is a couple of time tougher than the typical Homo Sapiens. Having more resilient to impact, pressure, and temperature extremes.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Reflexes: A seasoned Kree soldiers reactions are considered beyond those belonging to the finest human athlete, making it possible for them to dodge gunfire, even at point-blank range, from multiple gunmen at once.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Agility: The Kree are physically more limber than many species. Able to leap and bound at incredible heights in an instant.</p><p>Seventh Sense: The females of the Kree often undergo biophysical stunting surgery for the purpose of locating and removing psychic potential inherent among only they're gender. Uncastrated women among the Kree possess mental abilities ranging along clairvoyance, precognition and/or pheromonal and biophysical siphoning attributes. Powers that range from domination of the opposite sex to even lethal effect, like reaching into the mind of the opposite sex to moderate their desires or drain they're life force completely.</p><h2>Kree Groups</h2><h3>Attilan</h3><p>A group of Kree comes to <a href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\">Attilan</a> to beg for sanctuary. They are attacked at first until they tell what they're there. They are then given tents to stay in, in the empty place of old Kree machinery. A group of Kree goes to kill the Inhuman Royal Family but is stopped. Another is gone to the Genetics Council to see if the hearing goes in their favor for them to stay permanently. Another group is mad that they have to beg the Inhumans, creatures they created for their slaves. They decide to go and destroy the one thing that gives them their powers, the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/4055-55807/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55807\">Terrigen Crystals.</a> When they get there, they are attacked by Inhumans. They tell the Inhumans they don't want to destroy the mists but use them. They tell them when the Avengers hit the <a href=\"/nega-bands/4055-42360/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42360\">Nega Bands</a> above their city it did something to their genes so they could use the mists. Three went in and two came out alive.</p><p>The Kree attacked the Inhumans. They caught them very easily but with causalities. They separated the Inhumans by age, separating the old from the young. They sends machines over the city, for when <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a> screamed they picked the city up. The Kree wanted <a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\">Ronan</a> to help build up their status in the universe, they wanted to rule the <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a>. Ronan was to send the Inhumans to attack the Shi'ar.</p><h3>Priests of Pama</h3><p>The <a href=\"/priests-of-pama/4060-57481/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57481\">Priests of Pama</a> are a group of pacifist Kree.

Domino set free some women that were being trafficked and stole 237 million dollars that the Guild was after. They sent <a href=\"/razorfist/4005-15449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15449\">Razorfist</a> to get her, however he failed and they called <a href=\"/boomerang/4005-6299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6299\">Boomerang</a>, <a href=\"/nakh/4005-17371/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17371\">Nakh</a>, <a href=\"/clay/4005-6121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6121\">Clay</a>, <a href=\"/black-mamba/4005-30719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30719\">Black Mamba</a>, <a href=\"/bullet/4005-3125/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3125\">Bullet</a> and <a href=\"/bushwacker/4005-11932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11932\">Bushwacker</a> to go after her, as well as <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> who sided with her.</p><p>Most recently the Guild has turned its sights on <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> as during his years as the malfunctioning clone of <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a> he moved in on the Assassin Guilds' turf and took on contract killings without paying tithe to the Guild.

After beating the killers <a href=\"/bella-donna/4005-7896/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7896\">Bella Donna</a> sent after him, Kaine offered her a deal saying he would either do one job for her or he would kill each and every member of the Assassins Guild one by one.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The <a href=\"/vanisher/4005-6756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher</a> was never a moral individual. As a mutant with the ability to teleport anywhere he wished, he often used his skills to steal or blackmail others. Yet after an adventure when he was caught travelling through another dimension with the teleporting <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Man</a> known as <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, the Vanisher decided it was time to take life a little easier. So he settled down in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> and gathered around him a group of teenaged runaways.</p><p>In exchange for giving them shelter in his Beat Street Club, they would have to go out on the city streets and steal whatever they could find. Picking pockets, stealing purses and swiping food, they would take back their ill-gotten gains to the Vanisher who would then keep a large percentage of it for himself. Sometimes the Vanisher managed to recruit girls with super human powers, which would aid them in their daily quest to find more money and food. Yet the girls didn't always appreciate his unique brand of generosity, and sometimes girls like <a href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\">Boom-Boom</a> would leave after they demanded more.</p><h3>Aliens &amp; Cyborgs</h3><p>The all-girl group underwent a few changes after Boom-Boom was taken in by <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a> Most of the regular human girls left the team, leaving <a href=\"/ariel/4005-41840/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41840\">Ariel</a> and <a href=\"/chance-fallen-angels/4005-44914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44914\">Chance</a> to find new members. Chance was believed to be a normal human, while Ariel gladly used her space-bending teleportation as often as possible. Together they tracked down a young boy nicknamed <a href=\"/gomi/4005-7913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7913\">Gomi</a> (Japanese for 'garbage') and his two lobster associates <a href=\"/bill/4005-7631/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7631\">Bill</a> &amp; <a href=\"/don/4005-7912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7912\">Don</a></p><p>All three of them were cyborgs resulting from the experiments of Gomi's older cousin, while Don was also considered to be a mutant lobster due to his blue coloration. Unbeknownst to the Vanisher, Ariel had a hidden agenda; she didn't just want to repopulate his team of young thieves, she was recruiting as many mutated beings as she could find. As a team, this group of runaways would be known as the Fallen Angels.</p><h3>Mutants</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181224\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.9825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181224\"><img alt=\"Sunspot Knocks Cannonball Unconscious\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Sunspot Knocks Cannonball Unconscious</figcaption></figure><p>Gomi always was a hard worker, who didn't seem to mind doing the chores that no-one else wanted to do. Yet it was Chance who accidentally stumbled across their first new mutant. <a href=\"/sunspot/4005-4644/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4644\">Sunspot</a> had recently runaway from the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a> after he lashed out at his best friend and accidentally knocked <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a> unconscious.</p><p>He'd run away to the city where he found Chance being threatened by local street thugs. Although Ariel rescued Chance leaving Sunspot to face the thugs alone, they later went in search of their first mutant.</p><p>By the time Gomi, Bill &amp; Don found Sunspot, he was accompanied by Warlock. Fortunately for Ariel &amp; Chance, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> and <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a> had sent <a href=\"/siryn/4005-3181/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\">Siryn</a> &amp; <a href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\">Multiple Man</a> in search of the two runaway New Mutants and therefore they also joined the team. At the time they believed that Boom-Boom was being held prisoner by the mutant hunters, <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a>, so Ariel demonstrated her space-bending alien abilities to everyone just in time to save Boom-Boom as she was being chased by <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> &amp; <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>. Ariel's collection of young mutants was completed after a brief inter-galactic trip to a jungle-forest planet where they recruited <a href=\"/devil-dinosaur/4005-2172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2172\">Devil Dinosaur</a> and <a href=\"/moon-boy/4005-7224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7224\">Moon Boy</a>.</p><h3>Multiple Trouble</h3><p>Returning back to New York the Vanisher sent the team out to scavenge more food. They paired off with Ariel &amp; Chance, Sunspot &amp; Warlock, Siryn &amp; Multiple Man, and Boom-Boom with Gomi and the lobsters. While Ariel &amp; Chance were tormenting Sunspot &amp; Warlock, Boom-Boom discovered one of Multiple Man's duplicates wandering around the street. He desperately ran away from her and didn't watch where he was going when he ran into the street. A cyclist hit the duplicate breaking some of his ribs, the pain of which was fed to the original Multiple Man a few streets away.</p><p>In the midst of all the chaos, no-one had noticed that Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy had slipped out of the Beast Street Club. Despite the dinosaur's large physique and bizarre appearance on a New York street, they were unnoticed until a large cracking noise as heard. It was the tragic demise of Don, who had been crushed underfoot by Devil Dinosaur.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691891\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.40166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:40.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691891\"><img alt=\"Ariel &amp; Chance Nearly Spill The Beans To Boom-Boom\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Ariel &amp; Chance Nearly Spill The Beans To Boom-Boom</figcaption></figure><p>As the remaining Fallen Angels feasted at Don's wake, Multiple Man and his rogue duplicate discussed re-absorption, how that would be like dying, and the possibilities of further mutation. The duplicate didn't want to be re-absorbed and opted to have his own life, even if it meant living with the pain of broken ribs. They theorised that it was a further mutation or Multiple Man's own multiplying power. Using the portable <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> unit that Magneto had given them to find Sunspot &amp; Warlock, the Multiple Men began to detect the presence of two new mutants: Ariel &amp; Chance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the young mutants began to experience strange fluctuations in their mutant powers. A slight tap would trigger off dozens of Multiple Men duplicates, while Siryn could suddenly shatter metal, and the Vanisher vanished uncontrollably. Then as a complete reversal, all of their powers would suddenly disappear. Multiple Man's duplicates all mysteriously disappeared (except for the wounded one), Boom-Boom's time-bomb didn't detonate, and Warlock became murderously enraged. The wounded Multiple Man duplicate continued to study Cerebro, but he could not yet determine whether it was Chance or Ariel that was causing the trouble.</p><h3>Betrayal</h3><p>Ariel convinced the others that New York was too much trouble, and that she the best place for them: The Coconut Grove. There the team were treated like VIPs and received a make-over from their hosts. All except Chance who screamed in terror at the prospect of being feminine, and was subsequently mocked by Sunspot. The team was relaxed and didn't suspect a thing. The girls tormented Sunspot, Multiple Man gained another independent duplicate, and when Boom-Boom was accidentally left behind she didn't seem to mind since she was being praised by the locals for her amazing mutant powers.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174376\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.0845771144279\" data-width=\"201\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 201px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:208.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174376\"><img alt=\"Coconut Grove Make-Over\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" data-width=\"201\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg 201w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Coconut Grove Make-Over\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" data-width=\"201\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Coconut Grove Make-Over</figcaption></figure><p>Gathering together, Multiple Man revealed that Cerebro had not been wrong earlier. He continued to read distinctive mutant signatures from both Ariel and Chance, except for when all their mutant powers were cancelled out when only Chance registered. They deduced that Chance could 'Double or Nothing' their powers by increasing them or completely removing them, and Ariel had the gift of the gab by being able to sweet talk others into doing what she wanted. The whole conversation had been overheard by Coconut Grove guards who informed their leader, Unipar.</p><p>When the Coconut Grove guards attacked, the Fallen Angels were soon taken captive. Although Ariel's deal with Unipar meant that Chance was not to be taken too, they quickly seized her as they knew she was a mutant. Ariel turned to leave, so she didn't have to see the friends she'd betrayed, but then was immediately imprisoned within a force-field pillar. The captive Fallen Angels were thrown into a cell which dampened mutant powers, Gomi was blindfolded and locked inside a spinning cage, while Boom-Boom was being experimented on. Ariel remained inside her cramped pillar of energy, and was socially rejected by the rest of the team.</p><p>Unipar was determined to continue his experiments on the mutants. They would not go quietly, and therefore he shot the third Multiple Man duplicate. The death instantly sent a psychic feedback to the remaining Multiple Men and scared the others into silence. As all three Multiple Men were taken away, Sunspot offered to go to support his traumatised friend.</p><h3>Escape</h3><p>Due to his diminutive stature, Bill had remained undetected by the guards. The little green lobster cyborg made his way to the cells and battered any guard that was in his way. Finding the keys to the cell, he quickly liberated the team. They were ready to abandon Ariel, but took pity on her and freed her from the force-field pillar. They soon located Sunspot and the Multiple Men, who agreed to re-absorb and fight for their freedom.</p><p>Chance gained control over her powers and boosted the abilities of the others. Ariel used her voice based manipulation to convince Unipar to let them go. Devil Dinosaur destroyed the room and threatened savage violence if they were chased. Ultimately Unipar was informed that all of his scientific experiments were pointless, as their own kind had already begun to evolve again and Ariel was the living proof.</p><h3>The End</h3><p>Ariel returned everyone back to the Beat Street Club. Sunspot and Warlock parted to return to school. Boom-Boom returned to X-Factor. Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy were sent home to their jungle planet. Siryn and Multiple Man stayed with the remaining Fallen Angels saying that they were a good bunch who just needed a little guidance.</p><p> </p><h2>All-New Team</h2><p>A new team was formed by Psylocke (Kwannon), kid Cable and X-23. Husk and Bling also joined the team.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><p>The cover of the first issue of the first series says \"One moment of anger, and their lives are changed forever\". Although this may seem as just a marketing gimmick there is a sense of truth in it.</p><p>That is because all the events happening in this issue have impact right up until the end of \"The Fall of the Mutants\" story line, published in New Mutants 59-61. Because Sunspot hit Cannonball in rage after a game of footbal, he and Warlock left the New Mutants. They only came back at the end of \" The Fall of the Mutants\" story line. Just a few minutes after Sunspot and Warlock returned to help their teammates fight <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\">Cameron Hodge</a> and his elite robots, their friend and teammate Doug Ramsey (aka <a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Cypher</a>) was shot and killed. Though nothing is certain, but it could be possible that, had Sunspot and Warlock stayed with the New Mutants, they could have turned the tied in favor of the mutants, and thus preventing the death of Doug.</p><p> </p><h2>Epilogue</h2><h3>X-Team Adventures</h3><p>Eventually the rest of the team also disbanded. Gomi, Bill, Ariel and Chance have not been seen since, while Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy continue to re-appear in various places. Yet many of the other members have gone on to be in more popular teams, particularly X-Factor &amp; <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> Siryn and Multiple Man returned to <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\">Muir Island</a> at some undisclosed point, and were later mind controlled by the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a></p><p>Multiple Man joined the government backed incarnation of X-Factor and created X-Factor Investigates. Siryn became a long-time member of <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable's</a> X-Force, and rejoined Multiple Man in X-Factor.</p><p>Boom-Boom was also a long-term member of Cable's X-Force with Siryn, and later had a brief relationship with Sunspot. He joined and left X-Force on various occasions and became a public figure when working with the <a href=\"/x-corporation/4060-40425/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40425\">X-Corporation</a>. He even became the Lord Imperial of the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a> before aiding the <a href=\"/young-x-men/4060-51146/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51146\">Young X-Men</a> &amp; eventually reuniting with his New Mutants team-mates. Boom-Boom was a member of <a href=\"/nextwave/4060-40478/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40478\">NextWave</a> who fought an evil talking version of Devil Dinosaur who claimed he had eaten Moon Boy. Neither of them recalled their adventures together (although there are theories to state that was in an alternate reality).</p><p>Warlock has returned from the dead, and returned to outer space where he attempts to cure the <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a> of the <a href=\"/technarchy/4060-49537/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49537\">technarch</a> inflicted <a href=\"/techno-organic/4015-43631/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43631\">techno-virus</a>. He has since sired a son of his own, and is slated to appear in the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4050-26327/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26327\">New Mutants</a>. The Vanisher has been drafted into <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> &amp; <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine's</a> X-Force. He had previously encountered the first X-Force during a heist on Hawaii where he did not recognize Siryn and even tried to chat her up. During the Second Coming event, Vanisher was severely wounded and presumed to have died though he showed up later alive and well.</p><p>Ariel recently appeared aiding the X-Men during a riot in San Francisco and resided on Utopia. She was believed to have been killed in a car explosion during the Second Coming event but was actually trapped between dimensions since the car door she tried to escape through had been destroyed. Once the X-Club realized this, they were able to rescue Ariel.</p><p> </p>",

      "deck": "A race of immensely powerful immortals living on Oa, the planet at the center of the universe, who founded and run the Green Lantern Corps.",
      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Originally from the planet <a href=\"/maltus/4020-56204/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56204\">Maltus</a>, the race that would become the Guardians was one of the first races of intelligent life in the universe. Evolving quickly, they developed a society devoted to knowledge and science, often involving themselves in experiments on other planets. One of the Maltusians, <a href=\"/krona/4005-27246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27246\">Krona</a>, engaged in a forbidden experiment to witness the creation of the universe. Though his fellows attempted to stop him, the damage had been done and the universe was splintered, causing the creation of the <a href=\"/dc-multiverse/4015-43603/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43603\">Multiverse</a>, as well as the Antimatter universe <a href=\"/qward/4020-41619/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41619\">Qward</a>. The Maltusians relocated to <a href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\">Oa</a> and dedicated themselves to destroying the evil and rescuing the universe from chaos. To this end, they eventually harnessed the <a href=\"/glow/4015-55738/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55738\">Glow</a> to create the <a href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\">Central Power Battery</a> and ultimately the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. Later divisions in the group saw the creation of the <a href=\"/zamarons/4060-39176/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-39176\">Zamarons</a>, the <a href=\"/the-controllers/4060-22708/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22708\">Controllers</a>, and the Mesopotamian Gods and <a href=\"/leprechauns/4060-57730/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57730\">Leprechauns</a> on <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>The Guardians of the Universe were created by <a href=\"../../john-broome/26-48152/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Broome</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gil-kane/4040-1764/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1764\">Gil Kane</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Early Battles</h3><p>In their quest to confront evil and chaos, the Guardians come into conflict with a number of races, including the <a href=\"/the-reach/4060-48034/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48034\">Reach</a>, the <a href=\"/martians/4060-55381/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55381\">Martians</a> and the <a href=\"/legion/4005-52006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52006\">Tchkk-Tchkki</a>. They also deal with the entity <a href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\">Parallax</a>, and attempt to remove all the magic from the universe, resulting in the creation of the <a href=\"/starheart/4055-47348/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47348\">Starheart</a>. They create the <a href=\"/the-manhunters/4060-55857/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55857\">Manhunters</a>, precursors to the Lantern Corps, who ultimately rebel and remain eternal enemies of the Guardians.</p><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><p>The Guardians are unsure about the best way to handle the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis</a>. A small group of Guardians who favour aggressive involvement in combating the Crisis are the impetus for the recruitment of <a href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner</a> into the Corps. After the Crisis has ended, the Guardians are troubled by their indecisiveness and divisiveness during the Crisis, and decide to retreat from the universe.</p><h3>New Guardians</h3><p>The Guardians leave a sing Guardian, <a href=\"/appa-ali-apsa/4005-26914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26914\">Appa Ali Apsa</a>, behind to take care of Oa. The control of the Corps is handed to the Lanterns themselves, some of whom are tasked with watching over the so-called <a href=\"/new-guardians/4060-27245/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27245\">New Guardians</a>, super-advanced humans who are intended to be the next step in human evolution. The Guardians return to the main universe after Appa Ali Apsa goes mad and traps <a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a> in a nightmarish world of stolen cities. After defeating Apsa, the Guardians announce that they will remain in the main universe and remake the Lantern Corps. The newly-reformed Corps shows itself to be less docile, often questioning and even defying the Guardians' authority on occasion.</p><h3>Emerald Twilight</h3><p>Green Lantern <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> suffers a great personal tragedy that leaves him susceptible to the influence of the Parallax entity, which had been trapped for eons in the Central Power Battery. He travels to Oa where the Guardians release <a href=\"/sinestro/4005-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\">Sinestro</a>, who fails to defeat Jordan. The Guardians give their power and energy to one Guardian, <a href=\"/ganthet/4005-6951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6951\">Ganthet</a>, and are subsequently destroyed. Ganthet seeks out <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a>, who becomes the last Green Lantern. Sometime later, Rayner is able to resurrect the Guardians as children. These child Guardians are raised by Rayner, Ganthet and the Zamorans until Ganthet manages to artificially re-age them. They then set about restoring Oa and the Corps.</p><h3>Sinestro Corps War</h3><p>In response to the threat posed by the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps/4060-42352/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\">Sinestro Corps</a>, the Guardians decide to rewrite the <a href=\"/the-book-of-oa/4055-56006/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56006\">Book of Oa</a>, authorizing the Lanterns to use lethal force if it is deemed necessary, as well as introducing nine other new laws. They also remove reference to the <a href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night</a> prophecy, a change which is protested by Ganthet and <a href=\"/sayd/4005-45697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45697\">Sayd</a>, who are exiled. The Guardians then travel to Earth, where they appoint <a href=\"/sodam-yat/4005-46185/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46185\">Sodam Yat</a> as the new <a href=\"/ion/4015-55697/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55697\">Ion</a>. After the war is completed, the Guardians are rejoined by <a href=\"/scar/4005-56693/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56693\">Scar</a>.</p><h3>Blackest Night</h3><p>The Guardians realize that the <a href=\"/the-war-of-light/4015-55769/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55769\">War of Light</a> and the Blackest Night are coming, but are prevented from acting and imprisoned by Scar, who has become infected with evil. The Guardians are revealed to have hidden the fact that life actually began on Earth from the rest of the universe in order to protect the <a href=\"/the-entity/4005-69566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69566\">Entity</a>. They are released from imprisonment after <a href=\"/nekron/4005-45745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45745\">Nekron</a> is defeated.</p><h3>Brightest Day</h3><p>The Guardians return to Oa and retreat from many public duties due to their depleted number and their distress at the loss of faith in them that has been experienced by many Lanterns. They are confronted by <a href=\"/salaak/4005-11304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11304\">Salaak</a>, Rayner and <a href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\">Arisia</a>, and after the Lanterns depart the Guardians decide to repeal the new Third Law. Ganthet returns to them briefly to resign as a Guardian of any Corps, which the Guardians express sadness over. They officially make him the Lantern of Sector 0000.</p><h3>War of the Green Lanterns</h3><p>The Guardians are attacked by Krona, who has them possessed by six of the <a href=\"/emotional-embodiments/4015-55823/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55823\">emotional entities</a>. They are forced to attack Jordan and Gardner, who are traveling to the Central Battery to attempt to remove Parallax from it. They defeat the Lanterns, but allow them to escape after being distracted by the death of <a href=\"/mogo/4005-41919/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41919\">Mogo</a>. They are released from their possession by Jordan. The Guardians discharge Jordan from the Corps due to their fear that they would become like Krona if Jordan were allowed to remain. They allow Sinestro to rejoin the Corps. Following a rebellion among the Corps that results in the creation of the \"<a href=\"/new-guardians/4060-57179/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57179\">New Guardians</a>,\" the Guardians begin creating the \"<a href=\"/the-third-army/4060-59331/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59331\">Third Army</a>,\" intended to replace the Corps.</p><h3>Rise of the Third Army</h3><p>Believing the Green Lantern Corps is ultimately a failure, due to the members emotions becoming an unpredictable all the Guardians believe it is time to replace the Corps, except for Ganthet, who is later indoctrinated by his brethren. Before the begin of their plan, The Guardians use <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-hand/4005-31977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31977\">Black Hand</a> to seemingly kill both Sinestro and Hal Jordan (who had been using a duplicate of Sinestro's ring), an act which would lead to <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/simon-baz/4005-84895/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84895\">Simon Baz</a> receiving Sinestro's ring. The Guardians then use the power of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-first-lantern/4005-85389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85389\">The First Lantern</a> Volthoom, a time traveler who was the first to weild the power of the emotional specturm, only to be driven mad, to create the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-third-army/4060-59331/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59331\">The Third Army</a>, an army of mindless creatures who take over and transform their victims to multiply their numbers. All of the various Corps learn of the Guardians plan and begin to combat the Third Army, and though the Third Army would be defeated, Volthoom, the First Lantern would become free, and seek revenge on the universe.</p><h3>Wrath of the First Lantern</h3><p>With Volthoom free, he begins wreaking havoc on all the Corps. and their members, attempting to use their emotional spectrum energy to alter reality. Meanwhile, Simon Baz comes in contact with the Black Hand who transports him to the same dead zone Sinestro and Hal are trapped in. Sinestro manipulates Baz to help bring him back to life, while Hal is stuck in the dead zone, but as soon as Sinestro comes back to the realm of the living, the First Lantern destroys Korugar, and within the remnants, Sinestro finds his Sinestro Corps power battery. While the Corps wage war on the First Lantern, Hal makes a risky decision to use Black Hand's ring to return to the realm of the living, by taking his own life so the Black Ring would accept him. Hal, as a Black Lantern returns to fight Volthoom, using the Black Lantern Corps to fight the mad lantern, but it's not enough. Sinestro then offers himself up as a a host to <a href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\">Parallax</a> to fight Volthoom, but the First Lantern is still too strong. Volthoom finally falls when Hal summons <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nekron/4005-45745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45745\">Nekron</a> to kill the weakened lantern. With Volthoom defeated, Sinestro seaks his revenge on the Guardians, slaughtering every single one, leaving one for <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/atrocitus/4005-51905/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51905\">Atrocitus</a> to kill himself. Though the Green Lantern Corps believes the Guardians to be dead, secretly, Sinestro spared the life of Ganthet, reuniting him with his love, <a href=\"/sayd/4005-45697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45697\">Sayd</a>. </p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Justice League of America: The Nail</h3><p>The Guardians recall the Corps, less Hal Jordan, to intervene when the war between <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokolips</a> and <a href=\"/new-genesis/4020-41471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41471\">New Genesis</a> escalates.</p><h3>Superman &amp; Batman: Generations</h3><p><a href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\">Alan Scott's</a> ring is revealed to have actually been a <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Green Lantern ring</a>. The weaknesses in the rings are explained as being in the mind of the bearer; the Guardians instilled the weakness to yellow by telling members of the Corps that it was a weakness.</p><h3>Flashpoint</h3><p>The Guardians send <a href=\"/abin-sur/4005-22634/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22634\">Abin Sur</a> to Earth to locate the Entity. He becomes involved in the <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a>/<a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\">Amazon</a> War instead, which causes the Guardians to grow impatient.

After trying to raise such a person resulted in hopelessly psychotic children, Cain decided that he needed a genetically suited child and began searching for a possible mother. To this end he assassinated <a href=\"/carolyn-woosan/4005-36098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36098\">Carolyn Woosan</a>/Wu-San, one of two astonishingly talented martial artist sisters Carolyn's sister, Sandra, swore revenge and tracked Cain down, only to be subdued by the combined might of the League. However, she was frightened by the levels of skill she was attaining now that she was no longer held back due to her sister; Sandra agreed to be the mother of Cain's child in return, the League spared Sandra's life, and assisted her in further training. By the time Sandra gave birth, she had surpassed the entire League in skill and left immediately following the birth of her daughter, <a href=\"/cassandra-cain/4005-65230/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65230\">Cassandra Cain</a>, renamed herself Lady Shiva. The League attempted to train Cassandra from birth to be the ultimate assassin, unknowingly giving her the skills she would use as the hero <a href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\">Batgirl</a>. After the death of Ra's, his first born daughter <a href=\"/nyssa/4005-41476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41476\">Nyssa Raatko</a> formed a new League. Lady Shiva was recruited to serve as Sensei to this incarnation of the League with the intent that Cassandra would lead the warriors themselves.</p><p>Reflecting Shiva's emphasis for martial arts, the known members of Nyssa's League were all skilled in this area, and included the warriors <a href=\"/shrike/4005-6861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6861\">Shrike</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-kumbata/4005-6793/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6793\">Kitty Kumbata</a>, <a href=\"/wam-wam/4005-6795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6795\">Wam-Wam</a>, <a href=\"/joey-nbobo/4005-66532/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66532\">Joey N'Bobo</a>, <a href=\"/tigris/4005-70029/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70029\">Tigris</a>, Momotado, Krunk, <a href=\"/white-willow/4005-70028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70028\">White Willow</a>, the twin warriors Los Gemelos, Ox, <a href=\"/mad-dog/4005-66772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66772\">\"The Mad Dog\"</a>, <a href=\"/alpha/4005-9647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9647\">Alpha</a>, and Cristos. The new League was present when <a href=\"/mr-freeze/4005-3715/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\">Mr. Freeze</a>'s wife Nora Fries was brought back to life as the monstrous <a href=\"/lazara/4005-50698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50698\">Lazara</a>, and several members died in the resulting chaos.</p><p>Due to the conflict between their loyalty to Shiva and Nyssa and their near-worship of Batgirl as \"The One Who is All\", the League split at that point, with Ox, <a href=\"/white-willow/4005-70028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70028\">White Willow</a>, and Tigris pledging themselves to Cassandra. Several more members of the League (including all the defectors except Tigris) died when the insane \"Mad Dog\" went on a killing spree. \"The Mad Dog\", it was revealed, had been one of David Cain's early attempts to create Ra's' perfect warrior. The Mad Dog had been considered useless as a child, since Cain's methods had driven him murderously insane, and Ra's had ordered the child be killed. Nyssa, however, knew that the servant ordered to carry out this execution had instead released him into the wild, explaining how it was possible to recruit him. The Mad Dog was successful in killing Batgirl (who gave her life to protect the burqa-clad assassin Tigris). She was quickly restored to life in a Lazarus Pit by Shiva, in order that the two could face each other in a final battle.</p><p>After the <i><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a></i>, the League has been split in two.

Once, when <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine</a> broke into the Club's Manhattan mansion, he severed Pierce's cybernetic arm from the rest of his body. Months later, Pierce rebelled against the rest of the Inner Circle, which was dominated by mutants led by Black King <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/4005-2175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\"> Sebastian Shaw</a>. Pierce abducted Shaw's aide <a href=\"/sage/4005-4559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\"> Tessa</a> and held her captive. However, Pierce was thwarted by<a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\"> Professor Charles Xavier</a> and his new team, the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a>. Tessa regained her freedom, and Pierce was expelled from membership in the Inner Circle.

On the same night that he first met Pierce, Wolverine also encountered a squad of Hellfire Club mercenaries who had been sent to find and kill him. Wolverine lashed out at three of them—Cole, Macon, and Reese—with his <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\"> adamantium</a> claws, leaving the three of them severely wounded. The Inner Circle then had the three men converted into cyborgs. Cole, Macon, and Reese took Wolverine prisoner when the Inner Circle attacked the X-Men's Westchester County headquarters months later, but Wolverine overcame the three men once more. They were seen again working directly for Donald Pierce when he rebelled against the rest of the Hellfire Club.</p><p> </p><blockquote data-align=\"right\"><p><em>\"Lordy, I do love it when my plans comes together.

Their base was a ghost town which was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement and tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter <a href=\"/gateway/4005-4646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4646\"> Gateway </a>to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their violent robberies. Informed of the Reavers' existence by <a href=\"/roma/4005-14810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14810\"> Roma</a>, the X-Men expelled them from their Australian base, which they then co-opted for their own use.

However, three Reavers (<a href=\"/pretty-boy/4005-28113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28113\"> Pretty Boy</a>, <a href=\"/skullbuster/4005-29211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29211\"> Skullbuster</a>, and <a href=\"/bonebreaker/4005-28822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28822\"> Bonebreaker</a>) escaped. The Reavers were then reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce. Pierce combined the three survivors of the original Reavers with Lady Deathstrike and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries into a formidable team. While the X-Men, whose numbers had dwindled, were away from their Australian base, the Reavers retook the ghost town. When Wolverine returned from a leave of absence in <a href=\"/madripoor/4020-42665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\"> Madripoor</a> to find the X-Men gone, he was taken by surprise, captured, tortured and crucified by the Reavers. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\"> Psylocke </a>who had a premonition (her sporadic powers of precognition combining with Gateway's Aboriginal dreamtime) of danger waiting in the ghost town, took drastic action to escape when the X-Men were teleported back to the ghost town. Through telepathic mind control, she forced the remaining X-Men (herself included) to travel through the Siege Perilous, barely escaping the approaching Reavers and mystically re-birthing the X-Men elsewhere with no memory of their real lives. Wolverine later escapes the Reavers only with the aid of <a href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\"> Jubilee</a>.</p><h3>Versus the Punisher</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4416582\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2980935875217\" data-width=\"577\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 577px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4416582\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 577w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 493w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 577w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Around this time, in <a href=\"/the-punisher-vol-2/4050-3855/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3855\"> Punisher Volume II</a> #33, three Reavers, Bonebreaker, Reese and Pretty Boy, are dispatched to a <a href=\"/new-york-state/4020-56310/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56310\"> New York</a> warehouse after <a href=\"/microchip/4005-1526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1526\"> Microchip</a>, an associate of the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\"> Punisher</a>, in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Micro enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. One of the Reaver's biggest obstacles is a device designed by Micro, nicknamed Dalek. Its telescoping guns and multi-directional fire become very difficult to overcome. Even though, Punisher and Microchip barely survive. The Dalek and the warehouse are destroyed and the two escape through the sewer.</p><h3>Muir Island</h3><p>The Reavers then attacked <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\"> Muir Island</a>, theorizing that it was Wolverine's most likely destination. During the assault on Muir Island, they where counter-attacked by the make-shift mutant team known as the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/muir-island-x-men/4060-57847/\">Muir Island X-Men</a>. Durimg the attack, Skullbuster was rendered inoperative by sniper fire from <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\"> Forge</a>. Despite this loss, the Reavers managed to take out a number of mutants. Donald Pierce later transformed a gravely wounded pilot named <a href=\"/cylla/4005-26569/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26569\"> Cylla Markham</a> into the new Skullbuster (although she usually just went by the name Cylla).</p><h3>Upstarts</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181279-15685-reavers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181279\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5025\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181279-15685-reavers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181279\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181279-15685-reavers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181279-15685-reavers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181279-15685-reavers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181279-15685-reavers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As part of the Upstarts' game, <a href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/4005-8300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\"> Trevor Fitzroy</a> dispatches his own Sentinels to the Reavers' Australian hideout to kill Pierce (and anyone else they found there). In the ensuing battle, only Pierce, Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape the massacre, Pierce seemingly only making it as far as the Hellfire Club before he was \"killed\". Cylla later resurfaces, allying herself with <a href=\"/bloodscream/4005-15734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15734\"> Bloodscream </a>in an attempt to murder Wolverine. However, Bloodscream betrayed her and sucked the life from her, killing her. However, most Reavers somehow survive their supposed deaths. They later return to battle the X-Treme X-Men on behalf of the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\"> Shadow King</a>.</p><h3>New Reavers: Academy X</h3><p>Donald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti- mutant humans. This includes <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\"> Elixir</a>, who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant. They are defeated by a de-facto new version of the New Mutants. Pierce himself has the skin decayed from his body by Wither. He is turned over to the police. Pierce had injured Wallflower during the battle. Elixir saves her, when his former comrades learn of this, they give him a beating and kick him out of the organization. The group later breaks Pierce out of prison and makes another attempt on Elixir's life, but they are defeated by the surviving core members of the original New Mutants team.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><p>The Reavers returned to play a role in the current Messiah Complex event, under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike. Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the Purifiers upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team. Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force. In the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine's strike team, but not before killing the mutant Caliban and injuring Cable. Whether Deathstrike survived the clash, or whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada, remains to be seen.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><strong>Earth 295 (Age of Apocalypse)</strong></p><p>The Reavers in this alternate reality were headed by Donald Pierce and made up of members <a href=\"/clegg/4005-41007/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41007\"> Clegg</a>, <a href=\"/dead-eye/4005-61370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61370\"> Dead Eye</a>, Mangle, Slocum, and Vultura. They were human beings that were altered by Apocalypse with the Techno-Organic Virus. Put in charge of stopping the Human High Council's plan to use nuclear weapons to stop Apocalypse, they brainwashed <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\"> Captain Britain</a> and attacked Wolverine, <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\"> Carol Danvers</a>, and Gateway. Eventually, all of their members were defeated.</p><p><strong>Earth 1610 (Ultimate Reavers)</strong></p><p>Rather than being a specific team of super-villains, the Ultimate continuity's version of the Reavers are human gladiators who have undergone surgery to become cyborgs for the specific purpose of hunting down mutants on live television. They are led by Ultimate <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\"> Deadpool</a>. Some do retain the names of the 616 Reavers, such as 'Bonebreaker'.</p>",

These teams were used to further the creator’s power. <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\"> Selene</a> (the Black Queen of the Inner Circle) would be no different. As the White Queen (<a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\"> Emma Frost</a>) made a team of young/adolescent mutants, called the Hellions, to solidify her role in the Hellfire Club. Selene, too, would create a team of young, mutant adults though for, it would seem, more honorable reasons. Selene was to use the team to mold and create the future mutant leaders of the world. Though with Selene, there is always more then meets the eye. Selene would have an ulterior motive for the team know as The Upstarts!</p><h2>The Players</h2><p>Selene was very particular about those that she would recruit into the team. Only wanting the young, wealthy, powerful and elite. Those who would be powerful leaders in the future. Her only other criteria would be that they MUST be mutants.</p><p>The initial roster would include:</p><p><a href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/4005-8300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>: The teleporting, time traveling mutant from the future.</p><p><a href=\"/shinobi-shaw/4005-9704/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9704\">Shinobi Shaw</a>: The phasing son of the Inner Circle's Black King, Sebastion Shaw. Cunning and sly, Shinobi Shaw is willing to betray and do anything in order to further his self.</p><p>Other would join later in the game such as:</p><p><a href=\"/siena-blaze/4005-14865/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14865\">Siena Blaze</a>: wielding energies so powerful, each use depleted Earth further as her power were detrimental to the environment.</p><p><a href=\"/graydon-creed/4005-13351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\">Graydon Creed</a>(Tribune): the only baseline human, and future presidential candidate, to join the team also the mutant hating biological son of both <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\"> Mystique</a> and <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\"> Sabretooth</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/fenris/4005-23530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23530\">Fenris</a>: Twin Nazi sympathizers who require skin-to-skin contact with each other to enable use of their powers. (Probationary Member)</p><p><a href=\"/matsuo-tsurayaba/4005-15117/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15117\">Matsuo Tsurayaba</a>: powerful member of <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\"> The Hand</a>. (Probationary Member)</p><p>The team would need one last person, someone who could monitor and judge the competitions for the group, a referee of sorts. Selene would get in contact with an omnipathic mutant, with mental powers on par with both <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\"> Professor X</a> and <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\"> Jean Grey</a>, by name of <a href=\"/gamesmaster/4005-14866/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14866\"> Gamesmaster</a>. Though Selene organized/founded the team, he would monitor them and keep track of points to see who the winner of each game would be.</p><p>The Upstarts were unlike any other team. In joining the team each member was part of a secret competition, or games as they are referred to as being. Basically the group would be given targets (groups of people or individuals) and the Upstarts would have to assassinate them. Gamesmaster would award points based on the victim’s power, skill and their overall importance to the world. Points and competition were decided solely by Gamesmaster. The winner for smaller games would gain leadership of the Upstarts with complete loyalty and power granted to that person while they were wearing \"the ring.\" The ring signifies who the winner was. Selene also eluded that the grand prize would be immortality, a prize that each member wanted greatly.</p><p>In order to join the team one requirement must be met. The individual requesting membership would have to kill a member of the Inner Circle. In the beginning, things went smoothly and as planned. Resulting in many major events such as: The decimation and deaths of almost all of the Hellions as well as the <a href=\"/reavers/4060-9726/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\"> Reavers</a>. Additionally, the apparent deaths of Sebastion Shaw (Black King), Emma Frost (White Queen), Eric Lensherr (Magneto/ White King) &amp; <a href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\"> Donald Pierce</a> (White Rook). Selene's hidden agenda couldn't be going any better.</p><h2>Selene's Secret Plan</h2><p>In appearance, <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\"> Selene</a> would make it seem as though her reasoning for the team was completely honorable. Only wanting to find and mold the future mutant leaders of the world. A humanitarian effort if ever there was one. Though not all was as it seemed. True, she did want to find the future leaders, but this would be to fit her needs. There was a power struggle, one of huge proportions, in one of the most powerful factions in the world. It was in the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. Each of the members was plotting against one another. Deception, lies and manipulation; these were a regular thing and was what was to be expected. Selene, the Black Queen of the Inner Circle would be no different.</p><p>Her goal was simple, she wanted full control of the Inner Circle and in effect the Hellfire Club. This would never happen with the current members as they all wanted the same exact thing. So she would pick individuals with the powers and abilities to assassinate/kill those currently in the Inner Circle. She would sugar-coat the actions by calling it a competition or game. With each completed game another part of the Inner Circle would be removed, from the actual members to their followers. This would only leave Selene to be in the fullest control of the group. Here are some of the initial games.</p><p>-Payment for membership would be to kill one of the current members of the Inner Circle.</p><p>-Destroy any of the personal teams the Inner circles may have. i.e. the Reaver's who were the followers of Donald Pierce (White Rook).</p><p>-Kill the Hellions, loyal to Emma Frost the White Queen, and potential Inner Circle recruits in the future.</p><p>-The total annihilation of the entire group of the Inner Circle, excluding Selene.</p><p>If the ploy was successful there would only be the Black Queen, Selene, with all the power to herself. She would then have her team fill the emptied spot to create a new Inner Circle. Though as it would shortly be seen, Selene wasn't the only one playing a game for their own benefit. One, of the Upstarts would soon have plans of his own, that none were aware of. And there wasn't a thing anyone could do to stop him.</p><h2>The Gamesmaster</h2><p>The <a href=\"/gamesmaster/4005-14866/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14866\"> Gamesmaster'</a>s role was to be the quiet background member. He was only to be the referee with no other real role on the team. In actuality he was getting taken advantage of by Selene, only wanting him for his mental powers, powers that she would underestimate. Gamesmaster was no regular telepath, he was an omnipath with mental gifts so powerful any average telepath's mind would burn out. His mental powers were at such a level that he is linked/connected to every single mind on the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More then 6 million people's thoughts coursing through his mind all at one time. Even the powerful Professor X would not withstand that duress. He would find ease when he was asked to join the Upstarts. He found that when focusing on specific sets on individuals, rather then trying to block everyone’s thoughts, it would ease his pain. Gamesmaster enjoyed the games, he found the interesting, and especially liked the reprieve from the pain of his powers. The problem was that Selene's game was soon to end, and the game would be over. Or so she thought.</p><h2>The Gamesmaster's Game</h2><p>Selene No More</p><p>The Gamesmaster couldn't allow the games to end; he enjoyed them, to make them continue he would have to do a little manipulating, himself. Gamesmaster would have to use his powers in a way that he had never tried. He would have to mentally control another person to put his plans into play. Considering his amazing telepathic might, it shouldn't be a problem. He would select the maniacal Fitzroy. While Controlling Fitzroy he would have him use his powers to capture Selene. Fitzroy would prove successful and even put her in a torture machine from the future. All her experiences in her long life, battling some of the most powerful heroes from the X-Men and Excalibur, while all ranging from life threatening to simply casting a spell, they have not prepared her for such physical pain. Otherwise known as “spooling” the process involves being ripped to shreds and then reformed over and over and over again. Needless to say the pain was exquisite. Fitzroy fail-proofed his plan as well. The only way she could be freed is if someone took her place in the machine. No one in there right mind would do that, so Selene would be stuck their. Gamesmaster also fail-proofed his plan. If Selene, by chance, did free herself, she would blame Fitzroy, not the true person behind it. Once Selene was out of the way, Gamesmaster could use the Upstarts to his hearts content. He would control them and their lives like a game of chess. He would never have to worry of ramifications either, as he would never have physical contact with the teams either, since all connections with them would be through the astral plane. It was the perfect plan.</p><h2>Let The New Games Begin!</h2><p>Gamesmaster would now play an even larger role in the Upstarts. No longer simply a referee, he was participating in the games by manipulating and controlling his team. When he took over, new members would join like: Tribune (Graydon Creed), Fenris and Matsu'o from The Hand.</p><p>The games that he created were one the same path as those in the beginning. He would select target and this Upstarts would have to assassinate them for points. He picked some very hard targets and in most cases not successful at his attempts. Some of the targets were <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\"> Forge</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\"> Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\"> Storm</a>, <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\"> Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\"> Moira MacTaggert</a> and in one a death wasn't required. <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\"> Mr. Sinister</a> hired the team to attain D.N.A. from <a href=\"/proteus/4005-2165/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2165\"> Proteus</a> instead return with the D.N.A. of <a href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\"> Marvel Girl</a> (Rachel Summers, then using Phoenix as her code-name.) Gamesmaster had many games, some time multiple one at any given time. None would require more effort from him and his team the Upstarts, then the final one that they would participate in together.</p><p> </p><h2>Young Hunt / Child's Play</h2><p>Coming full circle Gamesmaster would have his final targets be the ones that got away in the very first game. The new/old target are the remaining living original <a href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\"> Hellions</a> and <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a> (in actuality all the remaining living New Mutants, save a few were all Hellions). Though now, these are no longer young, novice mutants who could get easily pushed over. Both teams are older, more experienced and are very spread out. They are all spread out out now and apart of different teams such as: <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\"> X-Force</a>, <a href=\"/mutant-liberation-front/4060-28349/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28349\"> Mutant Liberation Front</a> (MLF) and <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\"> New Warriors</a>. There were quite a few targets that the members of the Upstarts were to take on, including: <a href=\"/empath/4005-2173/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2173\"> Empath</a>, Thunderbird(now known as <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\"> Warpath</a>), <a href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\"> Firestar</a>, <a href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\"> Magma</a>, <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\"> Cannonball</a>, <a href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\"> Boom Boom</a>, <a href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\"> Karma</a>, <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\"> Moonstar</a>, <a href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\"> Rictor</a> and <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\"> Wolfsbane</a>. The key difference in this game is that Gamesmaster didn't want the captives to be killed, only captured. It can only be assumed that he grew bored with the Upstarts and was to use the captives mutants as his new pawns. His ploy was nearly successful and would have won if not for one, Paige Guthrie, the future <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a> known as <a href=\"/husk/4005-3426/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3426\"> Husk</a> and little sister of Cannonball.</p><h2>The New Game</h2><p>To Control The Future</p><p>Gamesmaster was always ready for a new challenging game, especially the one posed to him. Paige challenged the Gamesmaster to a race. A race to locate and control the future mutants of the world. She stated that Professor X, Magneto and the Hellfire Club would all be trying to find them as well. Being intrigued by the challenge, he quickly decides that he no longer had interest in the Young Hunt. He called the game off and released all his mentally captives ex-member's of the New Mutants and the Hellions. Not only would he call and end to the current game but he would follow that with the disbanding of the Upstarts. He felt that he no longer required them as he could continue his game alone.</p><h2>Where Are They Now</h2><p>It not likely that the Upstarts are to regroup and make an appearance. Many have passed away, unfortunately have this status be much more permanent the some of the \"death\" that they dealt out on their targets. Here is an update on the status' of each of the members.</p><p>Selene: is still actively scheming away hiding in the dark. She recently came into the company of the young mutant Wither and has plans in place for the both of them. Though nothing has been revealed about it.</p><p>Gamesmaster: After the Upstarts were disbanded, he would show up a few more times doing battle with the likes of both the X-Men and X-Force. After a lose at the hands of Jean Grey he seemingly disappeared. Though being that he is a telepath of high order, he may simply be hiding his presence till the right time.</p><p>Trevor Fitzroy: Though he would continue to wreak havok for many years to come he would finally run into his enemy from the future, Bishop, and be dispatched. It appears that his death is a permanent one.</p><p>Siena Blaze: Though she had immeasurable and deadly mutant energies at her disposal, in the end it wouldn't matter. She along with hundreds of other mutants would be captured and sent to Neverland, a facility ran by Weapon X. She would ultimately be placed in a gas chamber and be killed. Her power's would matter not as the building was harnessing the power dampening mutant Leech's powers to effectively depower all mutants in the vicinity.</p><p>Shinobi Shaw: Though he thought he was successful in his ploy to kill his father, he would be wrong. His father would reappear, very much, alive. Scared for his father retribution, Shinobi went into hiding and has yet to come out.</p><p>Fabian Cortez: Would attempt multiply time to kill Magneto, his one time savior. He was first attacked and thought to be killed by another of Magneto's over-zealous followers, Exodus. Though, truly he was alive, Magneto would find him and put an end to his life.</p><p>Graydon Creed: He would go as far a being a candidate for presidency, while giving a speech his very own mother, Mystique, would assassinate him.</p><p>Fenris: Of the two of them, Andrea and Andreas, only one would not meet their death. Andrea would, by chance, deduce the identity of a newly arrived Citizen V. Not wanting his secret out he would murder her in cold blood, ensuring his secret would be safe. A mind controlled Andreas, would find her body and show no real emotion, but would slice some of her skin off and have it added to the sword that he was carrying. He would have the skin tanned and added to the hilt of his sword so that he could maintain his power's which require skin contact with his sister and he would also take the role of the Swordsman working for the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\"> Thunderbolts</a>.</p><h2>Creators</h2><p>The Upstarts were created by both <a href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\"> Jim Lee</a> &amp; <a href=\"/whilce-portacio/4040-6024/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6024\"> Whilce Portacio</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Origins</h2><p>The Acolytes started out as a group on the run from American soldiers, and were led to <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\"> Magneto</a> by their leader <a href=\"/fabian-cortez/4005-9728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9728\"> Fabian Cortez</a>. When Magneto granted them refuge within his headquarters on <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/4020-41752/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\"> Asteroid M</a>, they left Fabian out in the cold and reformed as Acolytes under Magneto. But Fabian was incensed: before escaping Asteroid M, he helped bring about its destruction. When Asteroid M plummeted to Earth, the Acolytes perished and only Magneto survived.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Acolytes were created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\"> Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\"> Jim Lee</a> in 1991 and first appeared in <a href=\"/x-men/4050-4605/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4605\"> X-Men</a> # 1.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>Exodus</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/737456-414px_avalon_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737456\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4468599033816\" data-width=\"414\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 414px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/737456-414px_avalon_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737456\"><img alt=\"Avalon\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/35816/737456-414px_avalon_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/35816/737456-414px_avalon_001.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></a><figcaption>Avalon</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18265/1082119-cortez3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082119\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4811133200795\" data-width=\"503\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 503px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18265/1082119-cortez3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082119\"><img alt=\"Fabian Cortez\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/18265/1082119-cortez3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/18265/1082119-cortez3.jpg 503w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" data-width=\"648\"></a><figcaption>Fabian Cortez</figcaption></figure><p>Fabian Cortez was then free to lead a second incarnation of Acolytes whose first mission involved an attack on Our Mother of the Sacred Hear School to search for a child they hoped would become a powerful</p><p>mutant in his adolescence. Once the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a> stepped in, the Acolytes released the child - but only after finding out the boy had Down´s syndrome, which made him untrainable in the eyes of Acolytes. After the brutal killing of dying humans in the Sacred Heart School and an aborted attack on a military base, Magneto returned. Magneto, who was angry about Cortez´s betrayal, found and recruited the mutant known as <a href=\"/exodus/4005-4567/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4567\"> Exodus</a> to help him reclaim the Acolytes. After winning the leadership from Cortez, Magneto returned to space and build a new space station called the <a href=\"/avalon/4020-41283/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41283\"> Avalon</a> for the group with <a href=\"/shiar-empire/4020-23199/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23199\"> Shi´ar</a> technology.</p><p>When Exodus retreated to Avalon, he and the other Acolytes noticed a floating cocoon in outer space and brought it onboard. The cocoon housed the dimensionally displaced mutant called <a href=\"/holocaust/4005-15071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15071\"> Holocaust</a> who after he awakening killed several Acolytes. During Holocausts battle with Exodus, Holocaust sent Avalon and its occupants hurtling towards the Earth. Only those Acolytes who made it to an escape pod were saved.</p><p>By the time Avalon crash-landed, Magneto had been granted control over <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\"> Genosha</a> by the UN, and he attracted more Acolytes to help serve him on the island. But Magneto also faced the retribution of other Acolytes who mounted the Carrion Cove rebellion against his rule in Genosha.</p><h3>Post M-Day</h3><p>Several Acolytes were de-powered after M-Day, notably Magneto and Scanner. The Acolytes were then reformed by Exodus and because one of the major players in the search for the first mutant child to be born post M-Day. They battle the X-Men for control of the baby, Hope Summers. </p><p>A newly returned Xavier then assaults the Acolytes at New Avalon and confronts Exodus. Xavier persuades him that with so few new mutants now left, it is pointless to continue on fighting and Exodus agrees and disbands the Acolytes. Some of the Acolytes, such as notably Frenzy, go on to later join the X-Men.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Acolytes (current and former) confirmed to retain their powers are: Colossus, Exodus, Frenzy, Gargouille, Neophyte, Projector, Random, Senyaka, Skids, Tempo, Unuscione, Amelia Voght and Vindaloo</p><h2>Membership</h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><h3>The Iron Rebirth</h3><p><a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Tony Stark</a>, following the death of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers</a> at the hands of the <a href=\"/absorbing-man/4005-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1779\"> Absorbing Man</a> in Washington D.C., created robot duplicates of his fallen teammates to carry on in their name. Lead by the <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\"> Vision</a>, they were first sent to battle the alien hybrid \"the Hydra\"</p><p>When the Skull first arrived in New York City, the Iron Avengers were the first line of defense against the Skulls army against President Norman Osborne's headquarters. When the Skull found he couldn't take control of the Iron Avengers he had his army destroy them, which they did with great ease.</p><p>Following the death of the Skull, and Tony Stark's death while fighting the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\"> Celestials</a>, <a href=\"/king-britain/4005-10987/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10987\"> King Britain</a> (Brian Braddock) ordered that the Iron Avengers to be rebuilt. Over a three year period he worked with the Vision and his army of genetically altered Union Jacks to build an army of Iron Avengers to defend England and the Earth. While maintaining the same abilities of the originals, these Iron Avengers lacked the personalities of the Avengers the original Iron Avengers; as well as lacking ability to speak that the originals did. This may be because that only Stark had the genius and knowledge of his friends while they lived to program such complex personalities.</p><h3>Defending a strange new world</h3><p>This new army of Iron Avengers were now lead by the Black Knight (the son of Black Bolt, raised by Braddock) defended Buckingham Palace from an attack made by the Tong of Creel, who were searching for the broken pieces of the Absorbing man. One of those pieces were guarded by King Britain in an attempt to keep the absorbing man from reforming, the battle was lost when the Tong of Creel obtained the piece they had sought.</p><p>Later the Iron Avengers were sent with Black Knight to investigate one of the Human Torches in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\"> Savage Land</a> that appeared to have gone out because of neglect. While there <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\"> Black Bolt</a>, <a href=\"/iron-maiden/4005-10968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10968\"> Iron Maiden</a>, and <a href=\"/jade-dragon/4005-10956/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10956\"> Jade Dragon</a> joined in a great struggle with <a href=\"/toad/4005-1470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\"> Toad</a>, who switched abilities with <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\"> Magneto</a> following the worlds depolarization. The Toad used his new found magnetic powers to both abuse magneto for the years of torment his former boss had dealt to him and to take control of the Iron Avengers and used them to attack the heroes. At which point Black Bolt called in an entire army of Iron Avengers against Toad, and his robotic creation known only as Tank.</p><p>With the help of <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\"> Cable</a> (having been trapped beneath Sentinel City since the techno-organic virus that had consumed his body went out of control, having lost his telepathic powers when the rest of the telepaths lost their powers or died), Iron Maiden was able to stabilize the amount of Vibranium in that area of the world to reverse the power switch between Magneto and Toad . Upon regaining his powers Magneto repaired all the damage caused to Sentinel City and the Iron Avengers were free from the Toad's control.</p><p>The Iron Avengers later aided in battling the Absorbing Man when he literally absorbed the city of New York.</p><p>After the defeat of Absorbing Man ,the Iron Avengers have taken an even lesser involvement in the affairs on this universes' Earth. They have been seen as guards during the wedding ceremony of King Britain and <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\"> Medusa</a>. A number of Iron Avengers were sent along with the Iron Maiden into space on a rescue mission to save the <a href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\"> Eternals</a>, who were trapped in Vibranium .</p><p>Presently, it has never been revealed what the status of this mission is, and what the remaining Iron Avenger status are on Earth, but it is reasonable to assumable they have resumed their normal duties of defending as the global police force Tony Stark originally intended them for.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Each Iron Avenger had a similar likeness of their name sake, but also had similar features of Stark's many Iron Man armors. Each robotic construct could fly via jet boots, although the size differences of the <a href=\"/sting/4005-14437/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14437\"> Sting</a> and <a href=\"/monolith/4005-25741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25741\"> Monolith</a> , and the <a href=\"/steelbow/4005-24836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24836\"> Steelbows'</a> bow and arrows, it is unclear if the Iron Avengers were given the ability to mimic their name sakes super-human abilities.</p>",

      "deck": "The Micronauts are a team of freedom fighters, explorers and adventurers. Originally dedicated to fighting the tyrant Baron Karza who enslaved most of their planets in the Microverse, the team has stayed together after his defeat, exploring the Microverse.",
      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Micronauts came together as a direct response to <a href=\"/baron-karza/4005-31861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31861\">Baron Karza's</a> subjugation of <a href=\"/homeworld/4020-56594/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56594\">Homeworld</a> and most of the <a href=\"/microverse/4020-43832/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43832\">Microverse</a>. Upon the completion of his 1,000 year exploration, Commander Arcturus Rann arrived at his home planet Homeworld, the central planet in the Microverse and the new seat of power for Karza's empire, only to find himself arrested and enslaved by his former teacher Baron Karza. Karza jailed Rann in anticipation of sending him to the gladiatorial pits, where he would be forced to fight all manner of monsters and warriors from every corner of the Microverse for the entertainment of the rich elite of Homeworld, now virtually immortal thanks to Karza's Body Banks.</p><p>Prior to his first gladiator fight, Rann was attacked by a group of fellow prisoners. He would have been overcome save for the timely intervention of Acroyear and Bug who were already veterans of the arena. The three men soon realized that they all had a common enemy in Karza, and with the help of Marionette, a disguised princess Mari of Homeworld, the Micronauts escaped in Rann's spaceship <a href=\"/endeavor/4055-56304/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56304\">The Endeavor</a>.</p><h4>Original Team Roster:</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/arcturus-rann/4005-24681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24681\">Arcturus Rann</a></li><li><a href=\"/bug/4005-5049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5049\">Bug</a></li><li><a href=\"/acroyear/4005-31857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31857\">Acroyear</a></li><li><a href=\"/marionette/4005-24682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24682\">Marionette</a></li><li><a href=\"/biotron/4005-33647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33647\">Biotron</a></li><li><a href=\"/microtron/4005-32986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32986\">Microtron</a></li></ul><h2>Creation</h2><p>Marvel Comics writer and editor <a href=\"/bill-mantlo/4040-42478/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42478\">Bill Mantlo</a> recalls that The Micronauts as a comic book series originated on Christmas Day of 1977 when his son Adam received one of the new Micronauts toys as a present. Recognizing the story potential inherent in the toy line, Mantlo quickly convinced then editor in chief <a href=\"/jim-shooter/4040-40450/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40450\">Jim Shooter</a> to acquire the license. Mantlo would remain as writer on The Micronauts series for nearly all of its initial series run, finally turning over the writing reigns to <a href=\"/peter-b-gillis/4040-41742/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41742\">Peter B. Gillis</a> for its resurrection as <a href=\"/micronauts-the-new-voyages/4050-3353/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3353\">Micronauts The New Voyages</a>. The series team of Mantlo, and artist Michael Golden meshed uncannily well, creating a rich back story for the characters, and using nearly every toy in the line in one form or another.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The Micronauts unofficially disbanded after Karza's initial defeat at the hands of Commander Rann and The Enigma Force, with Bug and Acroyear returning to their respective homeworlds. Acroyear was crowned king of his home planet Spartak, however after killing his brother Shaitan for his crimes against the Acroyear race, Acroyear abdicated his throne and left to rejoin The Micronauts, taking his betrothed Cilicia with him. Along the way they are also rejoined by Bug and his Lady Jasmine. After many adventures the team eventually picks up Devil and Fireflyte.</p><h3>The Return of Baron Karza</h3><p>Thanks to his body banks, Karza was rendered virtually immortal, and the tyrant's death proved to be a mere respite for The Micronauts. Karza quickly re-cemented his hold on the Microverse even with The Micronauts and their allies to challenge him. Eventually, the Micronauts defeat Karza yet again, however their victory comes with the decimation of all life on Homeworld.</p><h3>The New Voyages</h3><p>After a long period of recuperation and reflection, the Micronauts again decide to stay together, setting out to find new adventures. At the start of their first journey, the team is thrown far off course, way beyond the <a href=\"/microverse/4020-43832/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43832\"> Microverse</a>. There they meet a strange alien life-form called Scion and he soon joins them aboard their ship.</p><p>After several more adventures the team is attacked by universal rolling waves of pain and they encounter a cosmic sized Time Traveller who seems to be in agony and lashes out at them. Tracing the pain waves back to their source, the team makes a final journey to Homeworld where in a last ditch effort to save the Microverse from tearing itself apart, the entire team uses Karza's machinery to open up The Prometheus Pit. They each take turns jumping into the Prometheus Pit where their essences seed new life into a reborn Microverse.</p><h3>The Retcon</h3><p>Marvel finally gave up the rights to the Micronauts toy line, however since much of what Bill Mantlo created for the series was original work, the Micronauts eventually reappeared in the pages of Alpha Flight renamed the Champions of the Microverse. Commander Rann, Marionette, and Bug are joined by newcomer Dexam in their quest to defeat the evil ruler of Anttica, Baron Zebek. </p><p> </p>",

      "description": "<h2>White Vs. Green Martians</h2><p>Eons ago the Evil Pale or \"White Martians\" invaded Earth. Without really caring for <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>, the White Martians brought destruction to Earth's environment. Besides the White Martians there were also the <a href=\"/green-martians/4060-30878/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-30878\">Green Martians</a>, a more peaceful race of martians. The White Martians rampage on Earth resulted in the slow down of superhuman evolution. Taking matters into their own hands the Green Martians imprisoned their counterparts in the Ghost Zone (also known as the Still Zone or <a href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone</a>) for what they thought to be forever. But, eventually the White Martians came back. After the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League Of America</a> defeated the White Martian's initial invasion, lead by the Hyperclan, the <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\">Martian Manhunter</a> wiped them of all their previous memories making them think that were and had always been only human. In an encounter with the wish-granting Id, J'onn J'onnz (the Martian Manhunter) inadvertently bought back his fellow martians through a wish she granted him of wanting company.</p><h2>The Hyperclan</h2><p>Extricating themselves from the Still Zone aka Ghost Zone or Phantom Zone, the White Martians returned to Earth in the guise of gods calling themselves the <a href=\"/hyperclan/4060-24524/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24524\">Hyperclan</a>. The Martians claimed their homeworld had been destroyed by negligence and greed and they offered to save Earth from a similar fate. The Hyperclan turned deserts into verdant paradises and ended crime by executing meta-criminals. This was all part of their insidious plan to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Earth's real heroes saw through this ruse and put a stop to it right away. All hope seemed lost after the White Martians took away the only means of defeating them, by burning them with fire. The Martians took this away from Earth by inhibiting the Earth's atmosphere with subatomic particles that inhibited any combustible reaction. To find a way around this the Justice Leagues lured the Martians to the <a href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/4020-41469/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41469\">Justice League Watchtower</a> and the moon aflame.</p><h2>Fernus</h2><p>After the events of the Obsidian Age, the Martian Manhunter sought out therapeutic help against his otherwise crippling fear of fire that affects all Martians. Mostly conquering this fear with the aid of the reforming criminal <a href=\"/scorch/4005-9054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9054\">Scorch</a>, J'onn however unlocked a personality buried within himself called <a href=\"/fernus/4005-73044/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73044\">Fernus</a>, a personality that was only kept in check through the Martian's genetic fear of fire. Unknown to all, save the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe</a>, the Martian race had once been a single race, called the Burning. The Guardians feared the Burning, at the time limited to Mars, would achieve interstellar flight and spread beyond Mars and inflict the rest of the cosmos with their chaos, as the Burning could reproduce asexually as long as they could find a proper flame. The Guardians found it necessary to descend on Mars and the Burning, breaking the Martians down into two species resulting in the Green and the White Martians, and creating their great fear of fire to prevent their Burning mentality from returning, something they were unable to completely remove.</p><p>When J'onn finally lost himself inside Fernus, the White Martians held in the Still Zone were amongst the first to suffer his ire and as a result, they were all butchered before the League arrived.</p><h2>Miss Martian</h2><p>Despite what Fernus did, it was not the end of the White Martian race. During the One Year Later gap, the Teen Titans recruited a young woman that looked very much like the Martian Manhunter called <a href=\"/miss-martian/4005-41145/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41145\">M'gann M'orzz</a>. However, like many that year, Megan didn't remain for long due to the turmoil the team was in at the time. After Cyborg returned and woke up with the knowledge that Raven had uncovered a traitor during the year he was out and was now on the run, the team ventured to the Australian Outback to meet with Megan before being pointed at Bombshell after refusing to expose her mind to the world. However, after the Titans had left, she did anyway, and discovered that Bombshell was the traitor and headed after them. Initially there was confusion when Bombshell blasted Megan out of her Green Martian guise, revealing that she was in fact a White Martian. Because of the White Martians dire reputation the Titans initially thought Megan was the traitor, before being blindsided by Bombshell.</p><p>Megan has since then revealed that her parents had sent her into the Vegan system when she was an infant to shield her from the wars plaguing their people, but when she came back they were gone and she headed to Earth. It is only known that she has met J'onn in person once, during the Brightest Day story arc, when she was ambushed and nearly slain in her Outback retreat by the insane Green Martian called <a href=\"/dkay-drazz/4005-74020/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74020\">D'kay</a> before J'onn arrived.</p><p> </p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p><strong>Real Names:</strong> Unpronounceable</p><h3>Occupation:</h3><p>Alien Occupiers</p><h3>Base:</h3><p>The Still Zone, first as their fortress, then later as a Justice League run prison.</p><h3>Height:</h3><p>Variable</p><h3>Weight:</h3><p>Variable</p><h3>Eyes:</h3><p>Red in their natural form</p><h3>Skin:</h3><p>Chalk White in their natural form</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>White Martian abilities are similar to those of the Green Martians, and they they have numerous superhuman powers, including superhuman strength, flight, invisibility, telepathy, shape-changing, phase-shifting (sometimes called variable density) which allows them to be either invulnerably tough or completely immaterial, and \"Martian vision\" (a form of energy projection from their eyes), but they also share the Green Martians' vulnerability to fire.</p>",

Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby Earth had genetic potential invested in it by the alien <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's then primitive Homo Sapiens, inspired from studying a dead <a href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\">Eternal</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/tuk/4005-34714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34714\">Tuk the caveboy</a> was the first offispring of Inhumans, living in 50000 BC.</p><p>A strange sub-species of humanity who were given a genetic boost by alien scientists some 20.000 years past. A race of beings dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and who through genetic manipulation have assumed varied appearances and powers.</p><p>Their goal was apparently twofold — to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a>. However, although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment for reasons which are not yet clear.</p><p>Their test subjects, the Inhumans, went on to form a society of their own, which thrived in seclusion from the rest of humanity and developed advanced technology. Experiments with the mutagenic Terrigen Mist gave them various powers, but also caused lasting genetic damage and deformities. This led to a long-term selective breeding program to try to mitigate the effects of these mutations. Their city <a href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\">Attilan</a> has frequently been relocated and, as of 2005 stories, rests in the oxygen-bearing Blue Area of the <a href=\"/the-moon/4020-42072/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\">Moon</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The once-secret existence of the race has come to light among the general public as the Inhumans interact more often with many of Earth's superheroes — including the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">the Avengers</a>, and the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> — whom they have aided against threats such as <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron 7</a>, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, and <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a>.</p><p>The Inhumans are led by their king, <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, and his royal family, consisting of <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a>, <a href=\"/karnak/4005-10975/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10975\">Karnak</a>, <a href=\"/gorgon/4005-4330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4330\">Gorgon</a>, <a href=\"/triton/4005-11428/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11428\">Triton</a>, <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>, <a href=\"/maximus/4005-3447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3447\">Maximus the Mad</a>, and the canine <a href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\">Lockjaw</a>. Both Crystal and Medusa have been members of the Fantastic Four; Crystal has also been a member of the Avengers.</p><h3>Caste System</h3><p>One interesting observation is that Attilan's society and culture are predicated on a conformist belief system which permits individuality as it applies to genetic development and physical and mental ability, but demands rigid conformity in that each member of society is assigned a place within that society according to those abilities following exposure to the Terrigen Mist. Once assigned, no Inhuman, no matter how great or powerful can change their place within this rigid caste system.</p><p>Another interesting note is that the Inhumans' culture strictly prohibits miscegenation, or racial combining, between Inhumans and other races. Although a member of the royal family, the Inhuman Crystal appears to have ignored this prohibition married outside of her caste to wed the mutant <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a>. However, this may be a privilege due to Crystal's standing as a member of the royal family.</p><p>In contrast it appears that such permissive behavior is lost on the children of the immediate members of the royal family. Gorgon's daughter, for example, attempted to form relationships outside of her caste and was strictly prohibited from doing so, although this may have been because her relationship was with an Alpha Primitive, a cloned creature with subhuman intellect bred for labor, the lowest Inhuman caste. It is not clear, however, whether commoners face such strict disciplinary measures under similar circumstances.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Attilan</h3><p>During their stay in Attilan on the moon, a group of Kree refugees arrived and was attacked by the Inhuman guards. When one of the Inhuman guards was outnumbered the Kree told him they came to beg for Sanctuary. This was a lie they said so they could get close to the Inhuman Royal Family and assassinate them. The Kree had found Medusa and Black Bolt playing in a garden since they renounced their monarchy and let Attilan decide for themselves. The Kree stayed in a part of Attilan which held old Kree machinery, in tents. Three Inhuman kids came here to play but saw three Kree soldiers. Having a dislike towards Kree they tried to scare them. One of the Kree children got a gun and shot one of the Inhumans in the leg. And then tried to shoot an Inhuman guard who was invincible. During this time in the Chambers of the Inhuman Genetics Council, the Kree was granted an open hearing to decide whether their sanctuary in the Blue Area is to be permanent or temporary. In the end the Inhumans sent the Kree away.</p><h3>Servants of The Kree</h3><p>However, Inhuman society changed radically recently. <a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\">Ronan the Accuser</a> sought to use the Inhumans as an army to disrupt the <a href=\"/shiar/4015-43138/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43138\">Shi'ar</a> control of the Kree after their defeat in the <a href=\"/operation-galactic-storm/4045-27758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-27758\">Kree-Shi'ar War</a>. Appearing over the city of Attilan, Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forced the Inhumans and their king, Black Bolt, to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. During their time in forced servitude, Ronan revealed that the Inhumans had always been intended as weapons in service to the Kree. To this end, much of the genetic attributes that were encoded in them during the original experiments were meant to give them the abilities and appearances of various alien races. The idea being that these Inhuman slaves could be used to infiltrate alien worlds and races to conduct espionage or assassinations to weaken potential conquests. Ronan used the Inhumans in just this manner, disrupting treaties being negotiated by the Shi'ar, and launching attacks on ships and bases. Eventually, Black Bolt sought to free his people by challenging Ronan to a personal battle. If Ronan won, the Inhumans would continue to serve him. If the king won, the Inhumans would go free. After a terrible battle, Black Bolt won and Ronan, demonstrating that the Kree still had honor, kept his word and left the Inhumans.</p><h3>Exile of the Royal Family</h3><p>All was not over however, as the Inhumans were not willing to just follow Black Bolt back to Earth. Pressure had been building in the closed society of Attilan since open contact with the outside world had been made. During their enslavement by Ronan, the Inhumans had wished for their freedom, but had also developed a sense of pride in their power and a belief in their own destiny. They no longer believed that Black Bolt or the royal family was fit to lead them in the new life they wanted, and they exiled the royal family from Attilan. The royal family returned to Earth to find their destiny. After suffering bigotry and living in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, they returned to Attilan which was located on the Blue Area of the Moon. The Inhumans are currently fostering better relations with Earth by sending students to a Wisconsin University.</p><h3>Son of M</h3><p>In the events of Son of M, Quicksilver stole the Terrigen Crystals in an attempt to give himself back his powers, and to give back the depowered mutants from M-Day their powers. The theft led to a conflict on <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a> between the repowered mutants (whose powers came back as too powerful for their own good, and eventually surrendered), the Inhumans, and the U.S. Office of National Emergency. The conflict ended with the O.N.E. confiscating the Terrigen crystals, to which Black Bolt then verbally declared war on the United States.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>, The <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a> went up to the moon to get away from it all. There he encountered the Inhumans. Nobody remembered their previous encounters but were intrigued by it. They allowed him to stay but in the end he left with <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, leaving Crystal with questions about their time together.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>In the Illuminati Black Bolt was discovered as a Skrull. It is believed that this Black Bolt was the same who fought an enraged <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> (see: <a href=\"/world-war-hulk/4045-42294/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42294\">World War Hulk</a>) and lost. After learning about Black Bolt's disappearance, Medusa confronts Iron Man who tells her that Black Bolt was kidnapped by Skrulls. This prompts Medusa to leave Iron Man and take the Skrull that was posing as Black Bolt and present the new Skrull invasion threat to the Inhuman Council. The Skrulls sprung their trap on the Inhumans and ravaged their city. Medusa acts and leads the Royal Family to steal the Skrulls spacecraft and leave Attilan to gain help from the Inhumans old master's, the Kree. Meanwhile on the ship that Black Bolt is held captive, they tell him that they captured him because they intend to use his voice as a weapon and obliterate Attilan.</p><p>After Medusa makes a pact with Ronan the Accuser, they embark on a quest to find out where the Skrull ship is headed and must split up into three groups to do everything they have to simultaneously. Meanwhile, it is learned that <a href=\"/ahura/4005-20610/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20610\">Ahura</a>, Black Bolt and Medusa's son, has also been taken captive by the Skrulls to use as leverage if Black Bolt does not do what they say. After the Inhumans complete their tasks, they prepare for an assault on the Skrull ship that has Black Bolt. As the fight begins, Black Bolt tells Ahura to go to Ry'bik (the Skrull scientist) and control his mind to let Black Bolt free. As this happens, Black Bolt kills Ry'bik and a Skrull female takes Ahura captive in attempt to bargain Black Bolt his life for hers. However Medusa kills her when she finds Black Bolt. The Royal Family return home and tell the Inhumans that they will return to their roots and go to the Kree who shall rule them. Eventually, the pact that Medusa made with Ronan turned out to be a marriage between Ronan and Medusa's younger sister Crystal.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>As the Inhumans where now married into the Kree Empire after the wedding between Ronan the Accusar and Crystal of the Inhumans, the two fractions worked together more closely. Disaster however struck when X-Men villain Vulcan, whom had become the Emperor of the Shi'ar Empire, attacked the Kree Empire right after their wedding. A huge war broke out, eventually leading to a fight between Vulcan and Black Bolt, seemingly resulting in the death of both. After Black Bolt's death during his battle with Vulcan at the end of the War of Kings, Medusa took control of the monarchy and ruled in his place. Some months later, Black Bolt returned, having survived his encounter with Vulcan. It was then that Black Bolt joined the Illuminati once more, this time in accompany with his brother Maximus the Mad.</p><h3>Infinity and the new Inhuman</h3><p>Some months after the events of War of Kings, the Inhuman city of Attilan had been located above the Hudson river in New York City. It its there that they learned that Thanos the mad Titan was heading towards Earth in order to reclaim and kill his Inhuman son, not knowing where this son was and how he looked like.</p><h2>Universal Inhumans</h2><p>It was a long held Inhuman secret that the Kree experimented on not only the human race but four other species as well. Known as the Universal Inhumans, they all were created to reignite the evolution of the Kree race and implanted with a genetic memory that would unite them together. The memory claims that the five queens will join the one king who returns from the forever night and band together in a new holy land which will be known as New Hala.</p><p>This one king happened to be Black bolt, who returned once again, to his people. Almost immediatly after his return, the Inhumans had to protect themselves against the Kree. With the help of their friends from Earth (and the sudden appearance of <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>), they managed to survive the attack.</p><h3><strong>Races</strong></h3><p>Along with the humans of Earth, the Kree also experimented on the <a href=\"/alpha-centaurians/4060-56555/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56555\">Alpha Centaurians</a>, the <a href=\"/badoon/4060-22907/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22907\">Badoon</a>, the <a href=\"/kymellians/4060-52945/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52945\">Kymellians</a> and the <a href=\"/dire-wraiths/4060-14015/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14015\">Dire Wraiths</a>. All of whom are led by a queen.</p><h3><strong>Catalysts</strong></h3><p>Terrigenesis - exposure to the mist of the Terrigen Crystals. Created the Inhumans of Earth.</p><p>Isogenesis - injection of the extract of the Isogen Orbs</p><p>Amphogenesis - one drop of diluted water of the dormant Amphogen</p><p>Antigenesis - eating the nectar of the Nightblooms of the Anitgen Tree</p><p>Exogenesis - inhaling the Exogen Spice</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Even without using the Terrigen Mist, the Kree modifications, combined with centuries of selective breeding, have given all Inhumans certain advantages. Their average lifespan is 150 years and an Inhuman in good physical condition possesses strength, reaction time, speed, and endurance greater than the finest of human athletes. Karnak and other normal Inhumans who are in excellent physical shape can lift one ton and are physically slightly superior to the peak of normal human physical achievement. However, most Inhumans are used to living in a pollution-free, germ-free environment and have difficulty tolerating Earth's current level of air and water pollution for any length of time. Exposure to the Terrigen Mist can both enhance and in some cases reduce these physical capabilities.</p><p><b>Inhuman Royal Family (Earth):</b></p><p><a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>: King of the Inhumans.</p><p><a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a>: Queen of the Inhumans.</p><p><a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>: Medusa's Sister.</p><p><a href=\"/gorgon/4005-4330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4330\">Gorgon</a>:Cousin of Medusa and Black Bolt.</p><p><a href=\"/karnak/4005-10975/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10975\">Karnak</a>: Cousin of Black Bolt.</p><p><a href=\"/luna/4005-10962/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10962\">Luna</a>: Daughter of Crystal and <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\">Lockjaw</a>: Transporter of the family.</p><p><a href=\"/triton/4005-11428/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11428\">Triton</a>: Cousin of Black Bolt and Brother to Karnak.</p><h2>Alternate Realities:</h2><h3>Earth-295 - Age of apocalypse</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1732564-inhumans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1732564\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6761133603239\" data-width=\"494\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 494px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1732564-inhumans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1732564\"><img alt=\"Age of apocalypse\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5774/1732564-inhumans.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5774/1732564-inhumans.jpg 494w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5774/1732564-inhumans.jpg 381w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px\" data-width=\"381\"></a><figcaption>Age of apocalypse</figcaption></figure><p>The entire family were killed by <a href=\"/maximus/4005-3447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3447\">Maximus</a>, who was become Death the most vicious Horseman of <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a>, later he used their bodies to create a loyal force of Inhumans beings altered by the Terrigen Mists.

This information was given to Black Bolt and Medusa in the past by <a href=\"/talon/4005-15993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15993\">Talon</a>, but it seemingly had no effect on his future.</p><p>The Inhumans would become part of an experiment by <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> in selective breeding.

It begins with two mountain climbers reached the walls of their city, Atillan, in the Himalayas when they are turned back with their memories erased. The Inhumans made themselves known to the Fantastic Four when a member of their royalty, Crystal, fled to New York after being ordered to marry Black Bolt's brother. Johnny came across Crystal and attempted to save her from two royal guards from Atillan who were trying to capture her. Beaten, Crystal took him back to the Baxter Building, and revealed herself to the Fantastic Four. She left her dog behind, who had the ability to teleport, which the Fantastic Four used to enter Atillan. Once their presence was discovered, the city was stripped of its advanced technology and destroyed by Black Bolt, and the Inhumans, including Crystal, relocated. They are hinted to have relocated to the moon.</p><p>The Ultimate Attilan is quite different in appearance from the MU version, like a giant wasp's nest crossed with a Gothic cathedral. Ultimate Crystal, Lockjaw and Black Bolt are similar to their counterparts; Medusa is depicted as having actual snakes for hair, like her mythical namesake. Gorgon is female, Karnak projects energy blasts (though he can still sense weaknesses and pressure points), Triton has a more squid-like appearance, and Maximus is a somewhat effete courtier, whom Crystal describes as \"preening\" and a \"peacock\". Other Inhumans shown include Tri-Clops with clairvoyant vision (including the power to see the invisible), Densitor (Maximus' flunky, who can presumably increase his strength, durability and mass, enough to become fireproof) and an unnamed Inhuman who can produce a swarm of insect-like flying creatures from his body.</p><p>They claimed that their city had remained secret for 10,000 years, which makes their ancestors contemporaries with Ultimate Marvel Atlantis. After the freeing of Namor by the Fantastic Four it is discovered that Atlantis and the Inhumans had been at war for thousands of years, and it was the Inhumans that finally sank Atlantis.</p><h3>Earth-9997 - Earth X</h3><p>The Royal Family consisting of Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, Luna, and Triton, left the solar system to go and find where they came from. Upon finding the planet they found out that vibranium destroyed it. They also found the Eternals covered in vibranium and couldn't get out. The came back to Earth to find Ahura who is going to be Luna's husband. When they came they wanted to find all Inhumans that was left on Earth. So they found Mr. fantastic and asked him if eh knew a way. He reconfigured Cerebro to find Inhumans and found out that all the people on Earth were Inhumans. Medusa thought about this and told Mr. Fantastic what happened. A while ago Maximus built a machine that would release the Terrigen Mists into Earth's atmosphere mutating the humans on birth. The Royal Family stopped him but at the loss of Lockjaw. Medusa figured it couldn't be Maximus since he was dead when people first started changing. It was Black Bolt, when he and the rest of the Royal Family left he didn't want the Inhumans to be discriminated against so he turned all of Earth into Inhumans. They used the fork on Lockjaw to teleport places.</p><h3>Earth-? - Millennial Visions</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-805648\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5886287625418\" data-width=\"897\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 897px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-805648\"><img alt=\"Millennial Visions One\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" data-width=\"402\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg 897w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg 402w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Millennial Visions One\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg 897w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805648-inhumansmv1.jpg 402w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" data-width=\"402\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Millennial Visions One</figcaption></figure><p>In this reality, Magneto confronted the Inhumans and tried to make them part of his empire. After confronting the Royal Family and being denied their support, Magneto is launched into a pitched battle with the Royals, resulting in the loss of his helmet. He attacks the Inhuman children in the mists room, only to have them stolen from him. Releasing the Mists into the castle itself, Magneto escapes, but Karnak orders the Castle to be encompassed in a large bubble, and sunk beneath the ocean waves. The Inhumans within the castle, and the bubble mutate further, with Medusa becoming aquatic, and having to live outside in the ocean itself.</p><p>In this world, the Inhumans were the Ultimate Cosmic weaponry. The Kree had originally designed the Inhumans to evolve into Galactus level threats, eating and destroying the Kree's enemies</p><p>on a planetary level. However, when the Royal family chose to embrace their evolution, their first target was the Kree Homeworld. In a last ditch effort, the Kree called to Galactus for help. Galactus sought out and waged war on the Inhumans, with a final battle between Black Bolt and the Devourer of Worlds. In the final battle, as Black Bolt screamed \"Die.\" it eradicated the two gods and tore a rift in space itself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-805649\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5297297297297\" data-width=\"925\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 925px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-805649\"><img alt=\"Millennial Visions Two\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg 925w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg 418w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Millennial Visions Two\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg 925w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28097/805649-inhumansmv2.jpg 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Millennial Visions Two</figcaption></figure><p>As Space was ripped apart, the remaining Inhumans used their powers to try and contain the destruction of the nearby universe, but it became glaringly obvious they were only delaying the unavoidable.

The team is initially formed in Fantastic Four #36 (1965) when <a href=\"/sandman/4005-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman</a> and Paste Pot Pete (<a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a>) are jointly escaping from prison and meet the Human Torch, who defeated them. Seeking to become an exact evil counterpart to the Fantastic Four, the Wizard needs a suitable female. He says that he knows of such a woman and that they will meet again in a few weeks. At their next meeting, an anxious Paste Pot Pete asks the Wizard if he has found a female whose power can match that of Susan Storm. The Wizard tells him that the female he has been considering might be even more powerful. Hence, they recruit a fourth member, the amnesic and inhuman <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa,</a> and attack the Fantastic Four at Reed and Sue's engagement party. First Paste-Pot Pete and the Wizard defeat the Thing. Then the Wizard, Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete smash Mr. Fantastic, while Madam Medusa defeats the Invisible Girl. Alicia Masters also gets captured and she, along with the three defeated Fantastic Four members, have anti-gravity discs attached to them and they float up into the atmosphere toward almost certain death, in a truly magnificent suspenseful criminal plan that reminds one of the cliffhanger serials from the 1930's and 1940's. However, unknown to the Frightful Four, Alicia Masters signals the Torch before she gets captured, as she finds an unconscious Sue Storm on the floor. Johnny Storm soon comes and captures the Wizard. This allows the Fantastic Four to barely snatch victory from the Frightful Four.</p><p>Their second encounter comes two issues later in Fantastic Four #38, \"Defeated by the Frightful Four\". Here Medusa is primarily responsible for the abduction of the Invisible Girl and the evil FF take Susan Storm to a deserted Pacific atoll and lay her in an underground chamber next to a Q-bomb, a powerful nuclear device. The three male members of the Fantastic Four soon follow, in an attempt to rescue their captive partner. A fight allows the Frightful Four to escape, but leaves the Fantastic Four trapped on the island. While they end up surviving the blast, their powers are now gone. Hence, this is the first defeat for the Fantastic Four at the end of an issue.</p><p>The third battle between the evil FF and the Fantastic Four takes place in the first Fantastic Four trilogy storyline in Fantastic Four #41-#43. Here the Wizard uses his I.D. machine to brainwash the Thing and this causes him to join the Frightful Four. This brilliant act allows the Frightful Four to defeat the Fantastic Four for a second time at the end of an issue in FF #41. However, Mr. Fantastic and Sue escape in FF #42 with the Thing and Mr. Fantastic breaks the Wizard's hold on Ben Grimm in FF #43 and this allows the Fantastic Four to eventually defeat their counterparts. The end of FF #43 has Medusa escaping, but her three male partners are arrested.</p><p>Though Sandman and the Wizard have solo battles against the FF over the next few years, the Frightful Four do not fight the Fantastic Four as a unit Fantastic Four #94. The three male members of the Frightful Four ambush the Fantastic Four and defeat them, along with the traitorous Madam Medusa. This happens at the mansion of the witch, Agatha Harkness. Unfortunately for the Frightful Four, Agatha Harkness and her black cat, Ebony, come to the rescue of the fallen Fantastic Four and easily defeat the Frightful Four (really Frightful Three at this point).</p><p>By the time the Frightful Four decide to make another attempt at destroying the Fantastic Four, Medusa is no longer a viable as she has completely reformed. As a replacement, the Wizard recruits <a href=\"/thundra/4005-7235/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7235\">Thundra</a> in Fantastic Four #129-#130. Yet again the Frightful Four temporarily defeat the Fantastic Four. However, before they can secure a permanent victory and finish the FF off, toddler Franklin Richards uses his powers for the first time, as he wakes up the Thing. A big fight soon follows and the Frightful Four lose yet again. As for Thundra, she proves to have no loyalty for this team as she eventually becomes attracted to the Thing and opposes the Frightful Four.</p><p>A rather weak Frightful Four story occurs in Fantastic Four #148, but a much better one develops in issue #177. Here the three male members of the Frightful Four defeat the Fantastic Four. Wizard then creates traps for the Fantastic Four members and each trap is designed to specifically negate his/her power. Wizard announces that he wants the Fantastic Four to remain alive, so they can watch the tryouts for a new fourth member of the Frightful Four.</p><p>They continue to plague the Fantastic Four, with different assortments of villains every time.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Frightful Four was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Following the defeat of the original team, the Wizard reforms the Frightful Four. Medusa soon deserts them after regaining her memories leaving the Wizard to make several attempts to create a fourth member for the Team. This lead to the recruitment of: <a href=\"/blastaar/4005-10963/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10963\">Blastaar</a>, using a mind-controlled <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"/thundra/4005-7235/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7235\">Thundra</a>, the <a href=\"/the-brute/4005-20090/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20090\">Brute</a> (an alternate Reed Richards from <a href=\"/counter-earth/4020-54572/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54572\">Counter-Earth</a>), and then <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a> when Spider-man had become a member of the Fantastic Four for a brief time and then later, <a href=\"/llyra/4005-2178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2178\">Llyra</a>, who took over the group and forced them to attack the <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Sub-Mariner</a> for her.</p><p>After the Sandman is merged with fellow Spider-Man rogue, <a href=\"/hydro-man/4005-4457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-man</a>, his mind starts to take on a more heroic theme and he joins <a href=\"/silver-sable/4005-7608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7608\">Silver Sable's</a> <a href=\"/wild-pack/4060-11879/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11879\">Wild Pack</a> and turns his back on the Wizard. The Wizard decides to form an all-new group with the <a href=\"/constrictor/4005-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2127\">Constrictor</a>, <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a>, and the <a href=\"/taskmaster/4005-4578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4578\">Taskmaster</a>, but they are bested easily by the Thing and Franklin Richards. Wizard next teams with the Trapster, the <a href=\"/man-bull/4005-13946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13946\">Man-Bull</a>, and <a href=\"/dreadknight/4005-16084/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16084\">Dreadknight</a>, and they try to make off with money from a rodeo, but they are defeated by the Turbine, Spider-Man, and <a href=\"/rangers/4060-42383/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42383\">the Rangers</a> on a test run in <a href=\"/canada/4020-55868/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55868\">Canada</a>. Following this huge defeat, the Wizard disbands the Frightful Four for a long time, but following the return of the Fantastic Four from Counter-Earth, he reforms the Frightful Four using the Trapster, The <a href=\"/punisher-robot/4005-27857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27857\">Punisher robot</a> and the <a href=\"/sharon-ventura/4005-20604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20604\">She-Thing</a> (failing to recruit the Sandman who the Wizard and used his mind devices to turn back to his criminals way) and attacks <a href=\"/wyatt-wingfoot/4005-10275/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10275\">Wyatt Wingfoot's</a> Keewazi reservation. When the heroic Fantastic Four seem to be led by Dr. Doom (actually Reed trapped in Doom's armor), Wizard surrenders rather than risk Doom's wrath.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2216/93465-124545-frightful-four.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93465\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5714285714286\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2216/93465-124545-frightful-four.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93465\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2216/93465-124545-frightful-four.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2216/93465-124545-frightful-four.gif 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" data-width=\"407\"></a></figure><p>The Wizard's next team is a dysfunctional echo of the Fantastic Four's family structure; including the Wizard's half-dragon, ex-wife <a href=\"/salamandra/4005-57596/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57596\">Salamandra,</a> and their mass-shifting daughter <a href=\"/cole/4005-57597/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57597\">Cole</a>; as well as Hydro-Man and the Trapster. Wanting to humble the Fantastic Four on equal terms, the Wizard \"traps\" the Trapster into a time-loop after he threatens Cole, reducing his team's ranks from five to four. With the rebellious Cole's aid, the Fantastic Four invade the Wizard's underground headquarters and defeat the Frightful Four, though the team escapes and remains at large.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/191285-100266-frightful-four.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191285\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4475\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/191285-100266-frightful-four.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191285\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/191285-100266-frightful-four.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/191285-100266-frightful-four.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/191285-100266-frightful-four.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/191285-100266-frightful-four.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Frightful Four reappears in Fantastic Four #547 with Wizard, Hydro-Man, and Trapster, being joined by <a href=\"/titania/4005-4943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\">Titania</a> as their female member, and they capture the Invisible Woman on Saturn's moon of Titan. This becomes the third time in the Frightful Four's history that they have made a captive of Susan Storm. (The other two being Fantastic Four #38 in May 1965 and FF:The World's Greatest Comic Magazine #9.), Wizard plants a listening device on Mister Fantastic's FTL (his latest spaceship) and a bomb. The Fantastic Four watch from Earth, as Wizard goads Mr. Fantastic by saying \"I'm about to kill your wife! Come and get me, if you can\". As they attempt to rocket to her aid in the FTL, the bomb explodes, leaving one of the best Fantastic Four cliffhanger endings ever at the end of issue #547. The next issue, Fantastic Four #548, shows Wizard beating a helpless Invisible Woman quite badly, as Wizard has created a trap which nullifies the blonde girl's powers. Wizard tries to force Susan Storm to admit that Wizard is superior to Mr. Fantastic, but she refuses to acknowledge such. Titania insists that they should kill Susan Storm, but the Wizard disagrees with her. By the end of #548, Wizard recreates <a href=\"/klaw/4005-3171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3171\">Klaw</a> to form his version of the Frightful Five to battle the Thing, Human Torch, Storm and Black Panther who had replaced Reed and Susan on the team for a time. It turns out though that the bomb aboard the Mr. Fantastic's ship is contained by the Invisible Woman. She is freed in issue #549 and then attacks the Wizard within an inch of his life as he asks for mercy.</p><p>The Wizard rejoins the <a href=\"/intelligencia/4060-56959/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56959\">Intellgencia</a> and decides to rebuild his Frightful Four in Hulk #19 (2010), but this time recruits Klaw and the Trapster (who has freed himself at this point) and the <a href=\"/savage-she-hulk/4005-27405/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27405\">Savage She-Hulk</a> to infiltrate the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a> and kidnap Reed Richards. Savage She-Hulk and Trapster keep the Human Torch and the Thing occupied. Klaw brilliantly defeats the Invisible Woman by imitating the sounds of her children being in danger and Wizard smashes Mr. Fantastic like he never has done before. Wizard wraps Reed Richards' body six times around the Baxter Building, until Mr. Fantastic apparently loses control of his bodily functions. Wizard then flees with the defeated Mr. Fantastic. However, his team is later defeated by both <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a> and the <a href=\"/general-thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">Red Hulk</a>. The Wizard eventually escapes, but is captured by both She-Hulks, before he is freed by the Future Foundation to fight in the War of the Four Cities. Following the end of the war, the Wizard returns to the Intellgencia and brings back the Trapster and Klaw, but does not know that Klaw is really the <a href=\"/chameleon/4005-4458/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4458\">Chameleon</a> in disguise as part of <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Dr. Octopus</a> master plan. The Wizard is currently trying to find a replacement for both Klaw and his female member.</p><p>The Wizard attacks the FF in Fantastic Four issues 003 and 004 (2014) as part of the Fall of the Fantastic Four arc. He now has three new members in his Frightful Four: Thunderball, Wrecker and a new Bulldozer, Marci Camp, daughter of Henry Camp, the original Bulldozer. This attack has been organized by some secret genius, but Wizard refuses to reveal the name.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/world-war-hulks/4045-55942/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55942\">World War Hulks</a></p><p><a href=\"/heroes-return/4045-56652/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56652\">Heroes Return</a></p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><p>On Earth-2149 the original Fantastic Four were turned into zombies.

Three of the trainees Oracle, Oink, and Orifice were only pictured in a single panel and did not later appear with the team because they din't make the team.</p><p>The O-Force television show airs with the mutants being Overkill, Orchid, Optoman, and Ozone. They compete in a fight onscreen, with Optoman taking the brunt of it. Later, as the team is assembled a video is shown across the nation of a practice mission. O-Force's first mission is to rescue a group of actors from a mansion filled with gunmen. X-Statix does not believe the mission is anything more then a set-up to make the actors and O-Force look good. This is confirmed by the thought bubbles of Solomon O'Sullivan, O-Force's agent. Then gunmen who threaten the actors then are later slaughtered to a man, wear the same uniform as the ones who killed many members of X-Statix-Force before.</p><p>It is announced on television that O-Force's next mission will be to take back a small town from the control of a reality-altering mutant named Arnie Lundberg. As Solomon briefs his tea, the Orphan breaks in tries to warn them. He is attacked and beaten by the team. They decided to go anyway.</p><p>The initial attack goes badly. An army of the undead, raised by Arnie, attacks the team. Ocean's legs are blown off. She begs Overkill for help but he abandons her. The Orphan parachutes in and saves Ocean. The rest of X-Statix quickly arrive as backup, thus saving the lives of O-Force. Arnie Lundberg is convinced to use his powers for good and heals Ocean's legs and the team is carted off by the ambulances.</p><p> </p>",

Later on the team change their name from X-Force to X-Statix.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>A <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel comics</a> team, X-Statix were created by writer <a href=\"/peter-milligan/4040-41484/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41484\">Peter Milligan</a> and artist <a href=\"/michael-mike-allred/4040-16768/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-16768\">Mike Allred</a> and first appeared (as X-Force) in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-force-116-exit-wounds/4000-64586/\">X-Force issue 116 </a>(2001).

Her last wish was to rename the team to X-Statix, and so they did. (It also meant a title change in 2002 with a new #1, continuing the story with characters from the previous X-Force). The comic was a humorous take on fame, celebrity and comic standards including \"comic book deaths\" which were rampant in the book. There was also the Princess Diana Controversy. X-Statix #13 was to feature the returned of famed figure, Princess Diana, as a mutant that had returned from the dead. Word got out to the media and <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel</a> dealt with the backlash by altering the character. She became a fictional pop-star Henrietta Hunter along with cosmetic alterations to keep likeness away from Princess Diana.

The Watchers gave nuclear technology to another race of aliens called <a href=\"/prosilicans/4060-59170/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59170\">Prosilicans</a> but they used the nuclear technology for war. The Watchers were very disappointed and vowed that they would never interfere with any events and to just observe and record.</p><p>The Watchers often came into conflict with the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a> because of their different way of judgment. The Celestials believed that if the race couldn't keep up with their genetic standards, they would use force to seal the planet and give the good people a chance to reform. The Watchers believed in just observing and recording and not just kill an entire race because they didn't reach the Celestial's standards.</p><p>It has been observed that the Watchers enter a state of consciousness (fugue) in which they appear to be uploading memories to their collective, and at that time are not observing and are unaware of their surroundings. This happens every three years for exactly 42 minutes. It has also been stated that some believe the Watchers to be infinite aspects of a single, powerful entity (although this contradicts the concepts of rogue Watchers and last of the Watchers, which has often been used in other stories).</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earh-691</h3><p>In this reality, the cruel <a href=\"/hawk-god/4005-35276/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35276\">Hawk-God</a> committed genocide on the <a href=\"/the-watchers/4060-11523/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11523\">Watchers</a>, leaving only one named <a href=\"/uilig/4005-63823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63823\">Uilig</a> alive. Uilig was able to get the cosmic beings to punish the Hawk-God for his crime.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Silver Surfer (1998)</h3><p>In the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4075-78/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-78\">Silver Surfer</a> animated series, Uatu is the last of the Watchers. Originally, the Watchers observed and collected information on their home planet, which would eventually be renamed the Universal Library, with all the information they had collected. Disobeying their vows, the Watchers created a miracle cure that saved billions, but in the process it caused them all to become the Virals, organisms with primitive appearances by enhanced minds that connected all of them into a single consciousness.</p><p>Being the last of his kind, Uatu felt responsible for them and returned to them with new knowledge when he could.</p>",

They would sue the dummy corporation in charge to try to shut down the site, but Iron Man would slip the information he hacked to She-Hulk. This led them to Hindsight, who was just trying to discourage the remaining New Warriors from staying active. That way everyone could forget about them, and their legacy won’t be what Speedball and their dead members did in Stamford.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/136362-62254-gauntlet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-136362\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/136362-62254-gauntlet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-136362\"><img alt=\"Injured Gauntlet with a painted NW\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/136362-62254-gauntlet.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/136362-62254-gauntlet.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Injured Gauntlet with a painted NW\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/136362-62254-gauntlet.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/136362-62254-gauntlet.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Injured Gauntlet with a painted NW</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">When the Superhuman Registration Act was finalized, Stamford was turned into a boot camp for would-be Avengers.

He regrouped them in Tennessee at MVP’s father’s home, which they correctly assumed would be attacked by KIA.

Then a street near a scene of one of these apprehensions was gratified with the phrase \"The New Warriors Were Here\". The scandal caught on fire, and many realized that the New Warriors were on their way coming back, however not with the many heroes that had participated in the team before. As the incident caught the media's attention, it was realized that someone had decided to re-form the New Warriors. There was, however, a fair amount of debate among the super-hero community (especially those close to Tony Stark) as to who would re-form a team whose only surviving member was branded as a mass murderer (because of their fight with Nitro). After all, except for Speedball, the former members of the team were dead, their bodies accounted for.</p><p>The new team was made up almost entirely of mutants de-powered by the decimation (all of whom were involved at some point with the X-men).

Almost all of the team perishes horribly. The only survivors are Six Pack and Bueno Excellente, though all present believe Six Pack to be dead when he merely went off to do battle with the demons in their own dimension and seemingly returns some time later, victorious, to discard his superhero costume and join up with Alcoholics Anonymous. Bueno Excellente is still on the loose somewhere and who knows, one day he may return.</p>",

there would appear to be one villain, but his <i><b>M</b>odus <b>O</b>perandi</i>  would seem to change with each crime, making his moves impossible to predict.  The Wildebeests were all master

demonstrated the ability to gain adult form to protect its \"Momma\".  Pantha originally didn't like the creature, often talking about various ways Baby could or would die.  Her attitude softened as Wildebeest stayed with the team.<br/><br/>During a Titans vacation to California, Baby Wildebeest and the other Titans had time to visit the beach.  While the others were distracted, he built a gigantic sandcastle, with intricate shapes and molding, resembling a cathedral.<br/><br/>When Pantha left the Titans, she took Baby Wildebeest with her and later, along with former Titan <a

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><blockquote data-align=\"right\"><p><em>\"But it could have! The Newsboy Legion is a foist rate outfit... just as it was durin' da forties!\"</em> -- Scrapper.</p></blockquote><p>The Newsboy Legion consisted of four orphans who lived on the streets of <a href=\"/suicide-slums/4020-56534/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56534\">Suicide Slum</a>, attempting to support themselves by honest means- selling newspapers. However, this business could not always support the group, and they occasionally turned to less licit means, generally stripping cars and selling the parts to Frankie the Fence. Eventually they made an attempt to rob a hardware store for tools to fix up the shack in which they were living, but failed. They had been frequently in trouble with the law because of their extra-legal activities, and this final crime had them brought before a judge who was about to sentence the boys to reform school until they came of age. However, Officer <a href=\"/guardian/4005-7644/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7644\">Jim Harper</a>, who had a soft spot for the boys, stepped in, and they were instead placed under his guardianship. The boys suspected that their guardian was in fact the superhero Guardian, however they remained unsure of his secret identity for much of their time together.</p><p>They were hired by <a href=\"/morgan-edge/4005-13100/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13100\">Morgan Edge</a> for building the <a href=\"/whiz-wagon/4055-55832/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55832\"><em>Whiz Wagon</em></a> and televising each stage of progress for viewing.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Newsboy Legion was created in 1942 by <a href=\"/joe-simon/4040-9443/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9443\">Joe Simon</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>. They were changed for the post-<a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis</a> universe by <a href=\"/roger-stern/4040-41502/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41502\">Roger Stern</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ron-frenz/4040-3364/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3364\">Ron Frenz</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The original Newsboy Legion consisted of <a href=\"/tommy-tompkins/4005-69760/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69760\">Tommy Thompkins</a>, the team leader; <a href=\"/anthony-rodriguez/4005-69762/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69762\">Big Words</a> (name later revealed to be Anthony Rodriguez), the smart guy of the group and also the tallest of the four boys; <a href=\"/johnny-gabrielli/4005-69761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69761\">Gabby</a> (name later revealed to be Johnny Gabrielli), the most talkative member of the group; and <a href=\"/patrick-macguire/4005-69764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69764\">Scrapper</a> (name later revealed to be Patrick MacGuire), the tough guy who loved to fight. The boys eventually grew up and attended college, where each became a scientist. All of them found work with the DNA Project. They eventually married, and each had a son who was identical to his father. These boys formed their own incarnation of the Newsboy Legion, with the only major difference between the incarnations being the addition of a new member, Walter \"<a href=\"/flip/4005-47785/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47785\">Flipper Dipper</a>\" Johnson Jr., an African-American boy who was fond of underwater maneuvers. The team was also briefly joined by \"Famous\" <a href=\"/famous-bobby/4005-73134/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73134\">Bobby Harper</a>, the niece of the Guardian, but she was soon sent to stay with other relatives.</p><p>Post-Crisis the younger Legion was retconned as identical clones that were created by the DNA Project as part of an abortive plot. These Newsboys had the memories of their fathers, but only up to their present age, leaving them occasionally unfamiliar with much of contemporary life and technology. Eventually, both versions of the Legion parted ways with the DNA Project, now known as <a href=\"/project-cadmus/4060-47233/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47233\">Project Cadmus</a>, because of changes being made to Cadmus. The younger Newsboys were involved in rescuing <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Kon-El</a> from Cadmus, and later they rescued <a href=\"/jimmy-olsen/4005-3213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\">Jimmy Olsen</a> from the sewers during <a href=\"/countdown-to-final-crisis/4045-56194/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56194\">Countdown</a>. They again aided Jimmy, this time in obtaining evidence of the <a href=\"/black-racer/4005-10032/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10032\">Black Racer's</a> death using the <a href=\"/whiz-wagon/4055-55832/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55832\">Whiz Wagon</a>. The original Legion was killed by <a href=\"/assassin/4005-35888/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35888\">Codename: Assassin</a>. The current status of the clones is unknown.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h4>Justice League Unlimited</h4><p>The Newsboy Legion appeared in the <i><a href=\"/justice-league/4060-55928/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55928\">Justice League</a> Unlimited </i>episode \"<em>Patriot Act</em>\", wherein they made an unnamed cameo appearance at a parade. There, they expressed discontent that none of the \"good\" heroes were present, and later witnessed the fight between various Leaguers and <a href=\"/general-eiling/4005-23237/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23237\">General Wade Eiling</a>. When the rest of the crowd fled the scene, the Newsboys remained behind and attempted to aid the Leaguers, their major effort involving throwing bits of debris at Eiling and commandeering a wrecking ball. They were assigned to crowd control by <a href=\"/vigilante/4005-6175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6175\">Vigilante</a>, who was hoping to keep them out of harm's way. At the end of the episode they were shown playing at being the members of the League that they had earlier disparaged.</p><h4>Young Justice</h4><p>In the DC streaming show, Young Justice, three girls (patterned off members of Scooby Doo's Mystery Inc) witness the team fight what appears to be an alien invasion. They each record different angles with their smartphones and are begrudgingly called the \"Newsgirl Legion\" by the town's mayor.</p>",

One theory holds they might be survivors of a previous universe. Another states they were created or in some way connected to <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\"> Eternity</a>. Another one states they were created by and serve an entity called the <a href=\"/the-fulcrum/4005-60755/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60755\"> Fulcrum</a> and help it maintain cosmic balance. Whatever their origin may be, one thing is for certain, they are a race of scientists and engineers who have taken upon themselves to \"shepherd\" the development of younger, \"lesser\" races such as <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"> The Skrulls</a>, though their reasons for doing so is unknown. One theory suggested is they seek to create the next Eternity.</p><p>Another theory suggests that doing so somehow serves the Fulcrum and, in turn, the balance between Order and Chaos. When the universe was still young, their race was never known to participate in wars, though they sometimes intervened whenever the probability of their experiments being ruined were too high for comfort.</p><p>But that all changed when they made first contact with <a href=\"/the-watchers/4060-11523/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11523\"> The Watchers</a>, whose views on the controversial subject of older races interfering with the natural development of younger races clashed directly with those of The Celestials. It was their differences of opinion ultimately ignited a war between the two races, unfortunately, the Oath of Non-Interference taken by The Watchers made it forever impossible to stop The Celestials, at least in a direct manner.</p><p>Thor witnessed the birth of a new Celestial in the midst of the <a href=\"/thor-the-black-galaxy-saga/4050-42051/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42051\"> Black Galaxy</a>, a bio-verse that was made of living matter. Other Celestials assembled its armor, with <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\"> Hercules</a> captured in its head. Then <a href=\"/stellaris/4005-25714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25714\"> Stellaris</a>, who hated the Celestials, rammed it at enormous speeds, sparking off a huge explosion, which expanded to reach the edges of the Black Galaxy, then contracted, focusing all of the power of the Black Galaxy into the new Celestial, which then came alive. It is not known if all Celestials are \"born\" this way.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Celestials are a Marvel comics book species created by Jack Kirby and first appearing in The Eternals #2 released in 1976. The Celestials first appear in The Eternals #2, and as a concept were created by Jack Kirby. They bare some semblance to Erich von Däniken ideas of giant space gods whose tampering with humanity lead to technological advancement.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>First Host</h3><p>The First Host of Celestials came to Earth about one million years ago to do genetic tests and experiments with the Earth's most intelligent life form, human beings. After many tests and experiments, the Celestials created two sub-species of humans, the <a href=\"../../eternals/65-13344/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Eternals</a> and the <a href=\"../../deviants/65-13345/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Deviants</a>. However, their manipulation of human DNA would give humans the potential to gain superhuman powers and also allow them to give birth to Mutants thanks to the insertion of the X-Gene. The Second Host of Celestials came to Earth about 18,000 B.C. to check upon the progress of the First Host's visit. After finding the directions of Deviants counter-productive and in response to Deviants firing on their ship, the Celestials decided to destroy <a href=\"../../lemuria/34-55791/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Lemuria</a>, the Deviants' kingdom. The combination of explosions and eruptions sank Lemuria, <a href=\"../../atlantis/34-41030/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Atlantis</a> and other similar civilizations into the ocean. This disaster became known as the <a href=\"../../the-great-cataclysm/12-55772/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Great Cataclysm</a>.</p><p>It was during this time that Tiamut the Communicator a.k.a. <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\"> The Dreaming Celestial</a> was framed by a cabal of Celestials lead by <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/4005-32857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32857\"> Arishem the Judge</a>, who was jealous of The Dreaming Celestials' intimate connection to <a href=\"/one-above-all/4005-29861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29861\"> The One Above All</a>. After a long battle with the treacherous traitors, The Dreaming Celestial was sealed away inside the Diablo Mountains for a crime he never committed, just as Arishem had hoped he would.</p><p>The Third Host of Celestials came to Earth around the 10th Century. The Incas, who worshiped the Celestials, built a City of the Space Gods high in the Andes mountains. The Third Host occupied this city as their main base on this visit. The <a href=\"../../council-of-godheads/65-48159/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Council of Godheads</a> of Earth confronted the Third Host with the Eternal <a href=\"../../ajak/29-34946/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Ajak</a> speaking for the Celestials. A pact of non-interference with humanity was agreed upon by the Celestials, Earth's Godheads, the Eternals and the Deviants until the arrival of the Fourth Host.</p><h3>Fourth Host</h3><p>In the late 20th Century, the Fourth Host of Celestials arrived on Earth to judge humanity. Fearing that the Celestials would destroy Earth if they judged against its people, <a href=\"../../zuras/29-13798/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Zuras</a> joined forces with <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\"> Odin</a> and led the Eternals into battle against the Celestials, who killed them for attempting to betray them. Odin, who had infused a Celestial-sized version of The Destroyer armor with the souls of nearly every Asgardian in existence along with his own, pushed onward and engaged The Celestials in combat. After wiping out Odin and The Asgardians and defeating an enraged <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor</a>, Arishem the Judge came to a decision and prepared to judge the Earth but not before attempting to end Thor's life. Luckily, <a href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\"> Gaea</a> arrived at the last minute and offered the Celestials the <a href=\"/young-gods/4060-41156/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41156\">Young Gods</a> who had been chosen to prove humanity's worth. This convinced Arishem to spare Thor and judge Earth worthy of continued existence. The Celestials then departed for space, taking Gaea's offerings with them. But this would not be the last time anyone would see the Celestials.</p><p>Months after the incident with The Fourth Host, Thor ended up being jettisoned into space where he crash-landed on the planet Pangora which Arishem the Judge had found unworthy of a continued existence, Thor made an attempt at driving the Celestial Judge away, but was ignored by Arishem while he summoned forth <a href=\"/exitar-the-exterminator/4005-44937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44937\"> Exitar the Exterminator</a>, a 20,000 foot Celestial who wielded the power to destroy worlds and purify entire galaxies. Thor tried to destroy Exitar from the inside by breaking the dome in his head that allowed Exitar to control his armor from hyperspace, where the true forms of all The Celestials resided, unfortunately Thor was unable to succeed in this endeavor and was spat out of Exitar's \"mouth\" like tobacco. Exitar then proceeded to purify the planet, eradicating only the Space Pirates who had been raping Pangoria and its people for over a thousand years. A clone of Thor created by Exitar explained their true intentions to Thor and told him that had he continued to interfere with their plans, Arishem would have altered his judgment and ordered Exitar to destroy the entire planet. The clone also warned Thor that should he interfere in their personal affairs ever again...they would obliterate him. With that, the clone exiled Thor from Pangoria while Arishem and Exitar enveloped the planet in a shield that would keep extraterrestrial intruders out from now on and then moved the planet to a safe and secret location.</p><h3>Fantastic Four</h3><p>The Celestials encountered The Fantastic Four, The Fantastic Force, <a href=\"/kristoff-vernard/4005-11829/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11829\"> Kristoff Vernard</a> and <a href=\"/scott-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\"> Scott Lang</a> a few years later during a crisis that almost saw an end to the millennia long war between the Celestials and the Watchers, who were saved at the last second by The Invisible Woman after she managed to cut Exitar the Exterminator off from the physical plane by using her connection to hyperspace to destroy the link between his true form and his colossal armor.</p><p><a href=\"/nezarr-the-calculator/4005-33689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33689\"> Nezzar the Calculator</a> and <a href=\"/ashema/4005-22835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22835\"> Ashema the Listener</a> later returned to Earth to force <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\"> Franklin Richards</a> into choosing which reality, Earth-616 or The Heroes Reborn Universe, would live and which would die. Their intentions were also to take Franklin with them and train him in the proper use of his cosmic power. A power they wished to manipulate for their own personal reasons, however, Ashema's newfound love for Humanity turned her away from this cause and lead her to store the Heroes Reborn Universe inside her own shell, which the other Celestials eventually gathered up and began studying, hinting at the possibility of a second ascension.</p><h3>The Thanos Imperative and Uncanny X-Men</h3><p>An army of Celestials were later seen on the front lines of <a href=\"/the-fault/4020-56597/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56597\"> The Fault</a> along with <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus</a> and <a href=\"/proemial-gods/4060-49441/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49441\"> The Proemial Gods</a>, only to either fall or be forced into a tactical retreat by <a href=\"/shuma-gorath/4005-14000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14000\"> Shuma-Gorath's</a> all-powerful <a href=\"/the-galactus-engine/4015-55741/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55741\"> Galactus Engine</a>. Later, thanks to <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\"> Mr. Sinister</a> tampering with the Dreaming Celestial, The Prime Celestial Host was drawn to Earth and touched down outside of San Francisco where The X-Men attempted to communicate with them.</p><p>However, they were not acknowledged by the Space-Gods as they were beneath them, luckily, the newly restored Dreaming Celestial stepped in on their behalf and sent his former brethren away as a way of showing his gratitude to The X-Men for saving his life.</p><h3>The Voldi Incident</h3><figure

energy they stole from the Celestials.</p><p>Using this power, the Voldi were able to hide from the Celestials, but when Recorder 451 stole the artifact their \"cloak\" dropped and revealed the location of their world-ship to The Celestials.</p><p>Seconds after the cloak dropped, a massive host of angry Celestials descended upon the Voldi and eradicated the entire species within moments.</p><p>With their thirst for revenge satisfied, the Celestials departed from the remains of the Voldi homeworld and returned to their standard routines.</p><h3>Assassination</h3><figure

They were at peace now and could rest easy as they moved on to their next lives.</p><h3>Earth-9997 (Earth X)</h3><p>How The Celestials began as a human-like race from the same universe as Galactus, their hunger for greater knowledge was so immense that they developed at a rather quick pace, so quick that they reached the apex of technology and understanding of the Universe faster than they expected. With the threat of stagnation on the horizon, The Celestials became desperate to find something else they could study and learn from.</p><p>Their own bodies proved to be their salvation, because they had focused all attention on learning about everything else, The Celestials knew very little about the inner workings of their own unique biology. Thus began a long series of experiments that resulting in their ascension into immortal beings made of pure anti-matter energy. Unfortunately, their actions had resulted in the loss of their ability to reproduce and ability to maintain cohesion on a physical plane of existence.</p><p>To fix the latter problem, they built massive armored suits which they could control remotely from hyperspace in order to interact with the physical world, however the threat of stagnation was still approaching and then, the rotted pillars holding their birth-reality together collapsed. Apparently, their experiments had destabilized the very fabric of time/space, causing it to implode.</p><p>However, their actions also lead to <a href=\"../../captain-universe/29-27193/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> The Enigma Force</a> transforming Galan of Taa into <a href=\"../../galactus/29-2149/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Galactus</a>, a young woman into the physical embodiment of the new <a href=\"../../death/29-12620/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Death Abstract</a> and the rise of <a href=\"../../phoenix-force/29-2164/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> The Phoenix</a>. Not only that but it had saved them from stagnation, with all of the new realities created in the wake of the original universe's death, they could literally do anything they wanted and feed their hunger for knowledge in the process.</p><p>In this reality, the first encounter between the Celestials and the Watchers resulted in the enslavement of the latter species due to their failure to stop the birth of the original Galactus. As punishment, The Celestials forced them to watch over the embryos they laid inside the hearts of planets. When a Fifth Host arrived to destroy Earth and bring about the birth of a new Celestial, they were driven back by Galactus (Franklin Richards), who then removed the embryo from the heart of the world and consumed it.</p><p>When The Celestials and Elders of The Universe were shut off from the worlds they were once able to freely manipulate, they focused all their rage on Franklin, who was saved by the new Eternity, a combination of his own Father and the fully restored Cosmic Consciousness of <a href=\"/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\"> Captain Universe</a>.</p><h3>Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2105303\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.37301587301587\" data-width=\"1134\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1134px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2105303\"><img alt=\"Xorn and The Celestials of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg 1134w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Xorn and The Celestials of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg 1134w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Xorn and The Celestials of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</figcaption></figure><p>In the Ultimate Universe, The Celestials are not nigh-omnipotent armored space gods but rather a group of forcibly-evolved humans that willfully serve under the benevolent rule of Kuyan-Yin a.k.a. <a href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\"> Xorn</a> in the \"Celestial City\" portion of Tian.

The Celestials have shown the ability to move planets at will, lay waste to entire worlds that they deem unfit for survival, destroy artifacts that are thought to be indestructible, such as the Asgardian <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\"> Destroyer</a> Armour, and even contain and destroy entire universes.</p><p>When the Skyfathers of Earth's dimension: <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\"> Odin</a>, <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\"> Zeus</a>, and <a href=\"/vishnu/4005-15392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15392\"> Vishnu</a> combined their energies into a single attack powerful enough to reduce an entire galaxy to nothingness and attacked the Celestial leader known as <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/4005-32857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32857\"> Arishem the Judge</a>, the combined might of the Skyfathers failed to even faze Arishem in the slightest. Arishem the Judge responded by threatening to permanently seal off the dimensional links to <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\"> Asgard</a>, <a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\"> Olympus</a>, and Nirvana along with the rest of the realms belonging to other Godheads, which frightened the Skyfathers to the point that they went down on their knees and acknowledged their inferiority to the all-powerful Celestial leader.</p><p>Despite their great power, it is still possible to \"injure\" a Celestial. One such instance was when a 2,000 feet tall Odin while wearing the Asgardian Destroyer Armour infused with the souls of all the Asgardians (except for <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor</a>), wielding the <a href=\"/odinsword/4055-55890/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55890\"> Odinsword</a> managed to cut off Nezzar's arm, although the Celestial regenerated instantly. <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\"> Tiamut</a> the Dreaming Celestial has gone as far as stating that it is impossible to truly kill a Celestial. However, a Celestial can be imprisoned by its fellow Celestials.</p><p><a href=\"/nathaniel-richards/4005-7221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7221\"> Nathaniel Richards</a> suspected that the source of the Celestial's powers were from Hyperspace. This theory would prove how <a href=\"../../invisible-woman/29-2190/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Invisible Woman</a> was able to crack a hole in <a href=\"../../exitar/29-44937/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Exitar</a> the Exterminator's armor and cut off his link to the physical realm, destroying his immense armor in the process. The Celestials are also capable of communicating with their counterparts from every reality and timeline in existence no matter what points in time they are inhabiting while communicating. This includes Past to Present, Past to Future, Present to Future and vice versa.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4>Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462054\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462054\"><img alt=\"A recording of the Celestials\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg 720w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A recording of the Celestials\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg 720w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462054-7740562188-celes.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A recording of the Celestials</figcaption></figure><p>The severed head of a Celestial appears in the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4025-1541/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1541\"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a> movie.

To test the adaptability of the human gene, the Celestials accelerated the evolution of a handful of subjects and gave them the genetic potential to mentally manipulate limited quantities of cosmic energy, as well as other superhuman traits. Thus the Celestials created the race of Eternals, an evolutionary offshoot of humanity. The Celestials also performed similar experiments on subjects that led to the creation of the <a href=\"/deviants/4060-13345/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13345\">Deviants</a>, another offshoot of humanity.</p><p>The Celestials altered the structure of the DNA complexes of the first generation of Deviants. The result was an unstable genetic code that radically changed the physical characteristics of Deviants with each generation. Thus a Deviant child will greatly differ in appearance from either of his or her parents. The Celestials experiments also involved implantation of latent genetic material in specimens of humanity's ancestors that would one day permit benevolent mutations in human beings.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>, the King of Comics, created the Eternals.

Though they are two separate species, Eternals and humans are capable of having children together when they mate but when a child is born of any Eternal and Human union the baby will always be human. Eternals have sworn to protect humans from their cousins the Deviants. Eternals also have higher technology than the human race. Eternals faced a civil war over if they should conquer other races. One side was lead by <a href=\"/kronos/4005-28005/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28005\">Kronos</a> who said they shouldn't while the other was lead by Uranos who said they should.</p><p>Kronos side won and Uranos left Earth and traveled to <a href=\"/uranus/4020-56295/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56295\">Uranus</a> where he and the rest built a civilization. Uranos and his group built a spaceship and attempted to return to Earth to start another war but they were attacked by a <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a> ship. The survivors among Uranos' group were forced to land on <a href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\">Titan</a>, Saturn's moon, giving rise to an Eternal civilization there. The Kree captured one of the Eternals and did experiments on him. This led the Kree to go to Earth and experiment on humans which led to another offshoot of humanity, the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>. Still powerful but not on the Eternals level.</p><p>Kronos started experimenting in cosmic energy until it went wrong and a destructive energy surge went through the Eternals' city, Titanos. The surge destroyed Titanos and bombarded the Eternals in irradiated energy which activated latent genes that gave them their long lifespans, virtual invulnerability and they found that they could manipulate cosmic energy. This gave them god-like abilities. The accident left Kronos' atoms scattered in an immaterial state but his astral form still survives on this plane of reality, quietly observing life in the universe.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-188527\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/188527-39084-uni-mind.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1425\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/188527-39084-uni-mind.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188527\"><img alt=\"The Uni- Mind\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/188527-39084-uni-mind.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/188527-39084-uni-mind.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Uni- Mind\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/188527-39084-uni-mind.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/188527-39084-uni-mind.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Uni- Mind</figcaption></figure><p>After the accident, Kronos' sons, <a href=\"/zuras/4005-13798/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13798\">Zuras</a> and A'Lars, initiated the first union of the <a href=\"/uni-mind/4005-14527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14527\">Uni-Mind</a>, a collective melding of the minds and bodies of the Eternals, to decide upon Kronos' successor as leader. Zuras was chosen as leader and to avoid further conflicts A'Lars left Earth and journeyed into outer space. A'Lars eventually discovered the war-torn remains of the Eternal civilization on Titan along with one survivor, <a href=\"/sui-san/4005-60709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60709\">Sui-San</a>. The two fell in love and in time repopulated Titan together as well as producing <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> and <a href=\"/starfox/4005-7257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7257\">Starfox</a> among their children.</p><p>A'Lars would be known as <a href=\"/mentor/4005-14522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14522\">Mentor</a>. Since Sui-San's latent gene was not activated by the cosmic energy of Kronos' lab accident, the Eternals of Titan are not as powerful or as long-lived as the Eternals of Earth. During the rule of Zuras on Earth, he directed the construction of the city of Olympia in a mountainous region in Greece. Two other Eternal cities were founded as well. Polaria in Siberia and Oceana in the Pacific. Olympia lay near the principal nexus between Earth's dimension and that of the <a href=\"/olympian-gods/4060-44825/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44825\">Olympian Gods</a> on Mount <a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\">Olympus</a>.</p><p>Zuras and <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>, leader of the Olympian gods, made a mutual non-interference pact between their two races. The people of ancient Greece and Rome often confused the Olympian Eternals with the Olympian Gods. Over the centuries, many Eternals went on to live lives among ordinary human beings. The Eternals have also continually fought the Deviants' attempts to gain power or to subjugate humanity.</p><p>Around the 10th Century, the <a href=\"/council-of-godheads/4060-48159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48159\">Council of Godheads</a> of Earth met with the Third Host of Celestials with the Eternal <a href=\"/ajak/4005-34946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34946\">Ajak</a> speaking for the Celestials. A pact of non-interference with humanity was agreed upon by the Celestials, Earth's Godheads, the Eternals and the Deviants until the arrival of the Fourth Host. The Eternals and the Deviants formed a truce until the Celestials' return.</p><p>In the late 20th Century, the Fourth Host of Celestials arrived on Earth to pass judgment and the Deviants renewed hostilities against the Eternals. The Deviants attempted to sabotage the arrival of the Fourth Host which was prevented by the Eternals. Two Deviants, <a href=\"/karkas/4005-13936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13936\">Karkas</a> and <a href=\"/ransak-the-reject/4005-14006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14006\">Ransak the Reject</a>, became allies of the Eternals and left Lemuria to become residents of Olympia.</p><p>Fearing that the Celestials would destroy Earth if they judged against its people, Zuras led the Eternals against the Celestials, who retaliated by killing him. The Celestials nevertheless judged in Earth's favor and left Earth. Zuras's daughter, <a href=\"/thena/4005-13822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13822\">Thena</a>, assumed the position of leader and Zuras is put to rest in Olympia.</p><p>Later, the Eternals are taken prisoners when the Deviants invade Olympia. The Eternals are able to escape and defeat their captors with the timely aid of <a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">James Rhodes</a> as <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>.</p><p>During this conflict, Thena was in mental contact with Zuras' spirit before it left this plane of reality, and thus learned that the Eternals were to leave Earth to explore space now that the Celestials had departed. The Eternals argued on this subject for a time and resolved that this matter can only be settled by joining in the Uni-Mind. Months later in New York, some <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> attended a party hosted by an Eternal called <a href=\"/sersi/4005-2118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2118\">Sersi</a>.</p><p>When other Eternals crashed the party to take Sersi to join the Uni-Mind, the Avengers assumed she was being kidnapped and called in the rest of the team to follow them to the Eternals' city of Olympia. The Eternals explained to the Avengers that Sersi was in no danger as well as the relevance of the Uni-Mind. They soon learned that one of the Avengers among them, Starfox, was also an Eternal and invites him to join the melding of the Uni-Mind.</p><p>Despite interference from <a href=\"/maelstrom/4005-2493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2493\">Maelstrom</a> wishing to siphon power from the Uni-Mind for himself, the Eternals survive this conflict with the aid of the Avengers. The Eternals did reach a decision as the Uni-Mind and they all agreed that the Eternals should leave Earth. Virtually all of Earth's Eternals left for space in the form of the Uni-Mind. However, the Eternals' collective consciousness in the Uni-Mind decreed that a small number of Eternals who were particularly involved in Earthly matters remain behind.</p><p>Among the Eternals who remained on Earth were Thena, their ruler, <a href=\"/ikaris/4005-13967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13967\">Ikaris</a>, Sersi, <a href=\"/makkari/4005-13945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13945\">Makkari</a>, <a href=\"/gilgamesh/4005-29157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29157\">Gilgamesh</a>, <a href=\"/pixie/4005-21205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21205\">Pixie</a>, <a href=\"/sprite/4005-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20588\">Sprite</a>, <a href=\"/cybele/4005-26127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26127\">Cybele</a>, <a href=\"/phastos/4005-20591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20591\">Phastos</a>, <a href=\"/khoryphos/4005-20590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20590\">Khoryphos</a> and <a href=\"/interloper/4005-14605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14605\">Interloper</a>. They also discovered the existence of Eternals on Titan and what happened to A'Lars (Mentor) as a result of Starfox being part of the Uni-Mind. The Eternals have helped Earth's heroes, particularly the Avengers, against several menaces. Sersi and Gilgamesh are also members of the Avengers but not on active status.</p><p>In the Neil Gaiman run, the Eternals had their memories erased. Sprite, an Eternal who will forever remain a child, was tired of people treating him like a child. So he erased the Eternals' memories and changed their perception of history. Mike Curry, a Doctor, dreamt of being Makkari and meeting Ikaris, one of the few Eternals who remembered more than the others, found more and more memories surfacing Mark/Makkari dismissed them as symptoms of overwork whilst believing he was losing his mind. Sersi was now a fashionable party planner. Thena was a weapons designer working for Stark Industries and was happily married with a young child. Druig was a politician in Vorozheika. Sprite had become a teeny sensation with tv shows, movies and other assorted merchandise. Zuras was a homeless drunk. Ikaris was kidnapped by a group of Deviants and tortured, seemingly in an attempt to kill him at the behest of a mysterious employer. When a party for various celebrities and dignitaries held to increase awareness of Vorozheika was attacked by armed gunman, several of the Eternals present briefly used their powers, albeit instinctively. This attack was made by rivals of Druig who sought to eliminate him. Makkari was the primary saviour of this incident, his superspeed kicking in and allowing him to remove the hail of bullets and disarming the attackers. Thena was taken by the armed gunman but escaped later on after remembering she was a warrior. She contacted Iron Man who quickly found her location. In the aftermath of the botched attack, Druig found his powers, if not his memories, awoken and set about establishing himself as the new ruler of Vorozheika by particularly brutal and sadistic means. The mysterious employer of the Deviants was revealed to be the Eternal Ajax who was entrusted with the task of monitoring events by Zuras prior to Sprite's reality warping.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-659417\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659417-familiars.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3291925465839\" data-width=\"322\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 322px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659417-familiars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659417\"><img alt=\"Makkari communicating with the Dreaming Celestial\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-width=\"322\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28028/659417-familiars.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28028/659417-familiars.jpg 322w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Makkari communicating with the Dreaming Celestial\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28028/659417-familiars.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28028/659417-familiars.jpg 322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-width=\"322\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Makkari communicating with the Dreaming Celestial</figcaption></figure><p>Ikaris remembered (after being atomized and regenerating in the Eternal bastion at the North Pole) and gathered the newly awoken Eternals (Sersi, Makkari and others) in a bid to stop a Deviant plot to awaken a sleeping Celestial (Ikaris was the only fully returned Eternal, the others had merely had their memories returned). It transpired that the sleeping Celestial was the same one who created the Deviants all those millennia ago and as a result was punished by the other Celestials. This Celestial's awakening was an event dire enough to worry the Watcher and even remind Galactus what it is like to know fear.</p><p>The Eternals gathered and formed a Uni-Mind in the hope they could either talk to or fight the Dreaming Celestial. Instead, it merely shut them off. This Celestial spoke to Makkari (who was created <em>specially</em> by this Celestial and as well as his super-speed has other interesting features hard-wired into his DNA) and told him that it will judge the Earth, but was unclear how long it would take. It also alluded to a mysterious threat called the Horde (the Locusts of the Universe?) which will come to Earth and consume all life. Following this the Celestial reverted to being dormant, becoming something of a tourist attraction in <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\">San Francisco</a>. The Eternals and the Avengers reached something of a peaceful resolution. Sprite, still completely human and completely unrepentant, tried to escape on a train but was found by Zuras who broke his neck and left the body.</p><p>Shortly after this an army of Deviants marched upon the Eternals' fortress. Their leader challenged Makkari to a duel. Makkari accepted, easily dodging the Deviant general's attacks. When it came to his own, instead Makkari spared the Deviant's life, fulfilling a Deviant prophecy regarding a being called the Skadrach. After this, Zuras, the Chief Eternal, orders Ikaris and Makkari to go out and search for the remaining Eternals. Unfortunately, the various loose ends have yet to be tied up as this series has yet to be followed.</p><p>When dead Celestials began raining down from the skies, Iron Man and <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> sought out the Eternals. The two heroes arrived to find all of the Eternals dead, save for the fatally wounded Ikaris. Before dying, Ikaris revealed that the Eternals had gone mad and destroyed themselves after learning the truth behind their origin. They were not made to protect the human race, but rather cultivate humanity as a \"pathogen\" against the <a href=\"/the-horde/4060-56162/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56162\">Horde</a>. With his last words, Ikaris begged Iron Man to stop the <a href=\"/dark-celestials/4060-63554/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-63554\">Final Host</a> from unleashing the Horde.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545224\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4235880398671\" data-width=\"602\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 602px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545224\"><img alt=\"Ikaris projecting eye beams\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-width=\"449\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg 602w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg 449w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ikaris projecting eye beams\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg 602w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/545224-etrnlsv2006_cov.jpg 449w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-width=\"449\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ikaris projecting eye beams</figcaption></figure><p>The Eternals’ bodily cells contain cosmic energy, and they maintain constant mental control over every molecule of their bodies. Eternals are virtually immortal, and can be restored to life even if the molecules of their bodies are scattered. All Eternals possess the capacity for superhuman strength, telepathy, flight, teleportation, illusion-casting, transmutation of organic and inorganic matter, and the generation of various forms of energy from their bodies, including force, heat, light, and other electromagnetic radiation. Some Eternals have devoted themselves to specializing in a particular facet of their powers, and can increase their proficiency in one area by decreasing their power in another. The Eternal who serves as Prime Eternal can generate blue flame which will merge anyone who passes through it into a Uni-Mind, a powerful psychic entity which embodies the collective power of every individual who created it. A Uni-Mind requires the participation of at least seven Eternals in order to succeed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/326270-83077-eternals.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-326270\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/326270-83077-eternals.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-326270\"><img alt=\"Eternals taking flight\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/326270-83077-eternals.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/326270-83077-eternals.jpg 0w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eternals taking flight\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/326270-83077-eternals.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/326270-83077-eternals.jpg 0w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eternals taking flight</figcaption></figure><p>The Eternals have complete control over their molecules.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Around a million years ago, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\" href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" slug=\"celestials\"> Celestials</a> of the First Host arrived on Earth to perform experiments on humankind. The Celestials altered the genetic code in a group of prehistoric humans that resulted in the first generation of Deviants. The result was an unstable genetic code that radically changed the physical characteristics of Deviants with each generation. Thus a Deviant child will greatly differ in appearance from either of his or her parents.<br/><br/>The Celestials' also performed different experiments on other prehistoric humans that resulted in the first generation of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\" href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" slug=\"eternals\"> Eternals</a>. The Celestials' other experiments produced the potential for mutation in humankind. The unstable genetic code of Deviants gives them power and abilities superior to humans but inferior to the Eternals' god-like powers. The non-human appearance of Deviants is also the result of their unstable genetic code.<br/><br/><h2>Creation</h2><a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" slug=\"jack-kirby\">Jack Kirby</a>, the King of Comics, created the Deviants. Kirby wrote and illustrated their first appearance in the Eternals vol 1 #1 (7/1976). <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11436\" href=\"/john-verpoorten/4005-11436/\" slug=\"john-verpoorten\">John Verpoorten</a> was the inker for this issue.<br/><br/><h2>Team Evolution</h2>At first, the Deviants kept themselves hidden underground founding the vast empire of Subterranea but the Deviants and the Eternals would have conflicts with each other. The Deviants developed a civilization and a technology more advanced than humanity. Around 18,500 B.C., the Deviants came to be the dominant race and enslaved humans while certain Eternals such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13967\" href=\"/ikaris/4005-13967/\" slug=\"ikaris\"> Ikaris</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-29157\" href=\"/gilgamesh/4005-29157/\" slug=\"gilgamesh\"> Gilgamesh</a> opposed the Deviants. The conflicts continued as the Deviants relied on science and technology for advantages against the Eternals' superior powers and strength. The Deviants also lacked immortality and experimented to increase their life-spans.<br/> <br/>The Deviants founded a city known as the City of Toads in the country of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55791\" href=\"/lemuria/4020-55791/\" slug=\"lemuria\"> Lemuria</a> on the Mu continent. By 18,000 B.C., the Deviants established a powerful empire and the only significant human opposition came from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\" href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" slug=\"atlantis\"> Atlantis</a>. During the arrival of the Second Host of Celestials, the Mu continent suffered a devastating catastrophe that sank the landmass along with Lemuria and Atlantis. The Deviant Emperor Phraug had ordered the conquest of Atlantis. <br/> <br/>Atra, a human priest in Lemuria who worshiped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-29092\" href=\"/set/4005-29092/\" slug=\"set\"> Set</a>, opposed the Deviants and had plans to conquer Lemuria with his allies, the Serpent Men, the children of Set. Atra crafted the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15780\" href=\"/serpent-crown/4055-15780/\" slug=\"serpent-crown\"> Serpent Crown</a> as a conduit for Set's power to achieve this goal. Phraug, a worshiper of Set as well, also coveted the Serpent Crown from Atra.<br/> <br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-36921\" href=\"/king-kamuu/4005-36921/\" slug=\"king-kamuu\"> Kamuu</a>, ruler of Atlantis, used magma pits near the city, normally used for heating Atlantis, to destroy invading fleets from Lemuria. The release of the pits' destructive power caused volcanic eruptions across the region that sank Atlantis. <br/> <br/>Atra had begun his attack on Lemuria as the first being to wear the Serpent Crown but Set did not allow his power to be used on his Deviant worshipers. The Deviants in Lemuria also spotted the Celestials' ship and fired upon them. The Celestials responded by firing upon Lemuria with destructive force that sank Lemuria as well. Phraug and Atra both died in the destruction of Lemuria and the Serpent Crown was lost for centuries.<br/> <br/>The combination of explosions and eruptions caused the whole continent of Mu to sink into the ocean. The Deviant survivors of what came to be known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55772\" href=\"/the-great-cataclysm/4015-55772/\" slug=\"the-great-cataclysm\"> Great Cataclysm</a> moved underground. The southern half of Lemuria had sank underground and the sea had been shut out from this area. Lemuria and the capital, the City of Toads, was re-established as the Deviants' subterranean kingdom. <br/> <br/>A Deviant survivor known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11939\" href=\"/kro/4005-11939/\" slug=\"kro\"> Warlord Kro</a> appeared to have the unique trait of immortality produced by the Deviants' unstable DNA. Kro kept this knowledge a secret from his Deviant brethren. Kro feared his own dissection as research into immortality and pretended to be his own descendants. <br/> <br/>The Deviants replaced the loss of their human slaves by creating cloned slaves but these clones either rebelled against or proved unable to serve the Deviants. These clones branched off into different subterranean factions and later became known as the Gortokians (the first <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56642\" href=\"/subterraneans/4060-56642/\" slug=\"subterraneans\"> Subterraneans</a>), the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55859\" href=\"/lava-men/4060-55859/\" slug=\"lava-men\"> Lava Men</a> (mutated branch of Gortokians), the Moloids (servants of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\" href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" slug=\"mole-man\"> Mole Man</a>) and the Tyrannoids (servants of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3468\" href=\"/tyrannus/4005-3468/\" slug=\"tyrannus\"> Tyrannus</a>). <br/> <br/>The Deviants developed an entire religion focused on worshiping a rogue Celestial known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\" href=\"/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" slug=\"dreaming-celestial\"> Dreaming Celestial</a> who was punished for an unknown crime. The Celestials have erased the Dreaming Celestial's true name from their records and keep his body inert in an underground vault. <br/> <br/>The Deviants somehow believed that the Dreaming Celestial was punished for their creation. The Deviant priesthood also believed in visions of the Deviants' revenge on the Celestials. The Deviant priests prepared for this event by gathering their most monstrous Deviants as an army and placed them in suspended animation.<br/> <br/>The Deviants and the Eternals continued to have conflicts with each other until the arrival of the Third Host of Celestials around the 10th Century. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48159\" href=\"/council-of-godheads/4060-48159/\" slug=\"council-of-godheads\"> Council of Godheads</a> of Earth met with the Third Host of Celestials with the Eternal <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34946\" href=\"/ajak/4005-34946/\" slug=\"ajak\"> Ajak</a> speaking for the Celestials. A pact of non-interference with humanity was agreed upon by the Celestials, Earth's Godheads, the Eternals and the Deviants until the arrival of the Fourth Host. The Eternals and the Deviants formed a truce until the Celestials' return. <br/> <br/>In the late 20th Century, the Fourth Host of Celestials arrived on Earth and the Deviants renewed hostilities against the Eternals. The Deviants attempted to sabotage the arrival of the Fourth Host which was prevented by the Eternals. Two Deviants, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13936\" href=\"/karkas/4005-13936/\" slug=\"karkas\"> Karkas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14006\" href=\"/ransak-the-reject/4005-14006/\" slug=\"ransak-the-reject\"> Ransak the Reject</a>, became allies of the Eternals and left Lemuria to become residents of Olympia. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14005\" href=\"/brother-tode/4005-14005/\" slug=\"brother-tode\">  <br/> <br/>Brother Tode</a>, the Deviants' ruler at the time, ordered construction of New Lemuria beneath New York and restoration of Lemuria after being damaged by the Celestial, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46841\" href=\"/eson-the-searcher/4005-46841/\" slug=\"eson-the-searcher\"> Eson</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\"> Thor</a> stopped the construction and New Lemuria was destroyed as a result. The Fourth Host finally passed judgment and judged in favor of Earth. The Celestials left Earth while Brother Tode ordered the invasion of the Eternals' city of Olympia and imprisoned all the Eternals using brain-mines. <br/> <br/>The Eternals are able to escape and defeat their captors with the timely aid of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\" href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" slug=\"war-machine\"> James Rhodes</a> as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\"> Iron Man</a>. Kro managed to escape while the rest of the defeated Deviants, which included Brother Tode and most of the ruling class, were transformed and fused into a giant block of stone by the Eternals. The stone cube remained in Olympia for several months.  <br/> <br/>When the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14527\" href=\"/uni-mind/4005-14527/\" slug=\"uni-mind\"> Uni-Mind</a> left Earth on a journey through the universe, the Uni-Mind brought the giant cube with it. Later, the restoration of Lemuria was finished by the remaining Deviants. Ranar, Brother Tode's son, demanded his right to succeed his father as ruler. A high ranking lord in the Deviant priesthood, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14491\" href=\"/ghaur/4005-14491/\" slug=\"ghaur\"> Ghaur</a>, refused Ranar and killed him. <br/> <br/>Warlord Kro was put into place as the Deviant ruler of Lemuria while Ghaur and the priesthood were the real power in the empire and used Kro as a puppet leader. Ghaur had plans for world domination and to gain significant power which was usually opposed by Earth's heroes, the Eternals and rogue Deviants such as Kro, Karkas and Ransak the Reject. <br/> <br/>The Deviant empire in Lemuria went through different terms of rulers when Ghaur was eventually defeated and apparently slain in battle. Later, Kro stepped down as ruler leaving another Deviant, Visara, to take his place. Visara was later killed in a rebellion against his rule. <br/> <br/>Ghaur was resurrected and returned to assume control of Lemuria. Some time later, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\" href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" slug=\"apocalypse\"> Apocalypse</a> launched an attack on Lemuria that caused mutations in the Deviant populace. Afterwards, Kro and Ghaur formed an uneasy alliance where both were forced to share power as rulers of Lemuria.",

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Hellfire Club is a centuries old organization with roots in Britain during the 18th Century. It's members were infamous rakes who used their connections within the club to further boost their social standing and to indulge their sexual excesses.</p><p>Over time the club has evolved to include high-flying business men and women, as well as the profitable descendants of royalty and other Hellfire Club members. Being a member of the Hellfire Club is an illustrious boost among elite society. However, there is an even more esoteric sect of individuals who run the Hellfire Club, known as the Inner Circle.</p><h3>The Inner Circle</h3><p>The Club is run by a small group of influential members who form the infamous Inner Circle. Named after chess pieces, members of the Inner Circle will take on the titles of the Black and White (and later also Red) Kings, Queens, Bishops, and Rooks. The final position of Lord Imperial is reserved for the most powerful member of the club. Additionally, prominent members have also had assistants that did not have official titles within the club.</p><p>The Inner Circle was not always mutant dominated, but few members in several generations were not mutants. The Inner Circle dominates the club and secretly influences the club's activities in order to achieve even more power and wealth.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Hellfire club was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\">John Byrne</a> and it made it's first appearance in <a href=\"/x-men-god-spare-the-child/4000-20114/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-20114\">Uncanny X-Man #129</a>.</p><p>Claremont was inspired by <a href=\"/the-hellfire-club/4060-59376/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59376\">The Hellfire Club</a> of the '60s British TV series <i>The Avengers</i> in the episode titled <i>\"A Touch of Brimstone\".</i> One of the protagonists--<a href=\"/emma-peel/4005-27294/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27294\">Emma Peel</a>-would inspire the designs for Emma Frost.</p><p>The name of the Hellfire Club can be traced back to socialite clubs in the real world that dates back as far as 18th century of Britain and Ireland. Men of high social standing would gather to take part in \"immoral acts\" that would remain a secret. This mainly pertained to intercourse with young women who were hired. The first was founded in London in 1719. Over the decades, new clubs would spring up using the Hellfire Club name. The club motto at one was \"Fais ce que tu voudras\", which translates to \"Do what thou wilt\". One of the many historically significant figures include Benjamin Franklin during 1758. In 1781, a man by the name of Joseph Alderson created a club based off the Hellfire Club's original ideals while at Brasenose College in Oxford , but his version was called the Phoenix Society (later named the Phoenix Common Room).</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The Hellfire Club was originally founded in 18th century England by, Sir Francis Dashwood, Duncan Munro and Scotman John Stuart (Third Earl of Butte). It had some connection to King James I and retained some of his writings on the occult from the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 1760s, it functioned as a social club for the elite of British society. The Club not only provided its members with pleasures, often of sorts that violated moral standards at the time, but also sewed as a means for the members to consolidate their Influence over British economic and political matters. During the Revolutionary War, Philadelphia members tried to obtain secret information from Major General Wallace Worthington.

However, it no longer revolves around the chessboard-based Inner Circle in high society. Instead, the Hellfire Club is a group of spoiled boys who attend Xavier's Academy for the Gifted. The members included Angel, Forge, Havok, Longshot Pyro, Quicksilver and Kitty Pryde. All of them, bar Kitty, had advanced beyond Epsilon-Delta level to Beta level, and often taunted others who they saw as below them.</p><p>They use the Danger Room for their own needs, including turning it into a nightclub complete with simulated girls for them to flirt with. They would often skip classes and break curfew to meet outside and roast marshmallows over a bonfire. Their rule breaking was often over-looked as they were favorites of Magneto. As a new student, Kitty wanted to study, but the other members of the club would steal her books to force her to play with them. If she ran away, they would spend hours chasing her around the mansion until she phased into the crawl space between walls to hide from them.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6707483-hellfire%20club%20thanks.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6707483\" data-ratio=\"0.74946921443737\" data-width=\"471\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 471px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6707483-hellfire%20club%20thanks.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6707483\"><img alt=\"X-Men: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" data-width=\"471\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6707483-hellfire%20club%20thanks.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6707483-hellfire%20club%20thanks.jpg 471w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men: The Animated Series\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6707483-hellfire%20club%20thanks.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6707483-hellfire%20club%20thanks.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" data-width=\"471\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men: The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em><strong><a href=\"/xmen-the-animated-series/4075-26/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-26\">X-Men: The Animated Series</a></strong></em> - The Hellfire Club appears in the multi-part \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" storyline.

Emma Frost used her telepathic powers with the powers of the five Stepford Cuckoos to attack Jean Grey's mind and force the Phoenix out of her body, which caused the explosion. When the X-Men had located &amp; retrieve Jean Grey, Emma Frost used her powers to disable the other X-Men allowing the Inner Circle to abduct Jean. They explained the history of the Phoenix to Jean, claiming that they wanted to eradicate the Phoenix. However, once inside Jean's mind, the Cuckoos followed Sebastian Shaw's order to unlock all of the barriers placed there by Professor Xavier.

When Strucker seemingly perished in the destruction of <a href=\"/hydra-island/4020-56352/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56352\">Hydra Island</a>, AIM broke all ties with the Secret Empire and Hydra. The organization eventually succeeded in overthrowing the government of the Caribbean island-nation of Boca Caliente, rechristening it “AIM Island.” However, in recent years, AIM has been plagued by infighting amongst various factions vying for control of the organization. <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">MODOK</a> and Monica Rappcini have fought for the title of Scientist Supreme, a third faction known as Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (<a href=\"/raid/4060-41729/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41729\">R.A.I.D.</a>) broke away to serve the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> (Johann Shmidt), while a fourth called Advanced Genocide Mechanics (<a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/agm/4060-62832/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62832\">A.G.M.</a>) surfaced in the Congo.</p><p>AIM has fought against many superheroes and villains alike. And is the focal point of a continuing investigation by <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a>. SHIELD even raided a secret android processing facility in the Florida swamps that was funded by AIM. AIM retaliated by raiding SHIELD's base of operations in New York. And as a result, AIM's base was utterly destroyed.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>AIM hired <a href=\"/batroc/4005-1529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1529\">Batroc</a> the leaper to steal for them a substance known as Inferno 42.

These two factions did battle even dragging <a href=\"/deathbird/4005-6089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6089\">Deathbird</a> into the fray. The Yellow faction captured <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> and <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> for study. The Blue faction tried to re-create the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\">Cosmic Cube</a>. But currently neither faction seems active, they seem to have become one unit again.</p><p>AIM succeeded in murdering M.O.D.O.K. when they hired the <a href=\"/serpent-society/4060-28980/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28980\">Serpent Society</a>.</p><p>AIM has used jets to assault the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers</a> compound.

It is established that in the <a href=\"/marvel-cinematic-universe/4015-56089/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56089\">MCU</a>, A.I.M. was founded sometime after the year 2000 by<a href=\"/dr-aldrich-killian/4005-83640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83640\"> Aldrich Killian</a>, who had wanted to get Tony Stark involved as an investor. When Stark humiliated Killian and rebuffed his attempts to sway him, Killian took matters into his own hands. By 2013, A.I.M. was a successful government-sanctioned think-tank, with Killian acting as the leader. The group secretly begins experimenting with <a href=\"/maya-hansen/4005-50599/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50599\">Maya Hansen</a>'s Extremis virus, which they test on soldiers returning home from the wars in the Middle East.</p><p>A.I.M. is also hired by the U.S. military to redesign the <a href=\"/war-machine-armor/4055-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56065\">War Machine armor</a>, rechristening it the <a href=\"/iron-patriot-armor/4055-57274/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57274\">Iron Patriot</a>. Killian attempts to force Tony to fix a flaw in Extremis in order to perfect it, while at the same time launching a plan to assassinate the president in order to install a puppet regime. In the final battle, Tony uses his Iron Legion in a massive battle against A.I.M.'s Extremis soldiers.</p><p>In the continuity of the film, the A.I.M. scientists do not wear their yellow outfits from the comics.</p><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6390521\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6390521\"><img alt=\"Armored Adventures\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Armored Adventures\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6390521-aim%20figure.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Armored Adventures</figcaption></figure><ul><li>In <a href=\"/iron-man-the-animated-series/4075-136/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-136\"><em>Iron Man: The Animated Series</em></a>, it's revealed that A.I.M. is responsible for the murder of <a href=\"/howard-stark/4005-48549/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48549\">Howard Stark</a>.</li><li>In <a href=\"/iron-man-armored-adventures/4075-225/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-225\"><em>Iron Man: Armored Adventures</em></a>, the members of A.I.M. appear as recurring antagonists throughout the course of the show, frequently clashing with Iron Man and his allies.

The Wraiths specialty is the blackest and foulest of magic, and their cruelty is spectacular even by the standards of comic book villainy, with forced mating, torture and appallingly savage murderesses their standard operating procedure.</p><p>The paradise world of <a href=\"/galador/4020-57293/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57293\">Galador</a> explored the Dark Nebula over two centuries ago, only to have its fleet annihilated by the Dire Wraiths. The Galadorians created a squadron of star travelling cyborgs called the <a href=\"/spaceknights/4060-41517/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41517\">Spaceknights</a> to defend Galador, a job they did extremely well ever since.</p><p>A final climactic battle freed Galador, at terrible cost.</p><p>After the battle, <a href=\"/rom/4005-2189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2189\">Rom</a> pursued the Dire Wraiths back to the Dark Nebula, driving them from their ghastly planet <a href=\"/wraithworld/4020-56024/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56024\">Wraithworld</a> and scattering them throughout the universe.</p><p><a href=\"/rom/4005-2189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2189\">Rom</a> and the other Spaceknights swore a mighty blood oath to hunt down the Wraiths and exterminate them wherever they might be found.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>The Dire Wraiths made their fist appearance in Rom #1, 1979. They were created by <a href=\"/bill-mantlo/4040-42478/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42478\">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"/al-milgrom/4040-3259/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3259\">Al Milgrom</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The preferred method for the benevolent Galadorian Spaceknights to use was Neutralization, a process where the Dire Wraiths lost their physical host body and were cast into Limbo. The Wraiths preferred death to banishment because in Limbo they could still view the universe, but could not affect it.</p><p>When Rom, their greatest nemesis, arrived on Earth, it was to discover that the males and females of the Wraith species were in a civil war and the native-born Earthling Wraiths and their parents from Wraithworld were also at loggerheads. Female Wraiths use sorcery, males traditionally use science, although there are exceptions such as <a href=\"/doctor-dredd/4005-69378/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69378\">Doctor Dredd</a>.</p><p>In sorcery they used Deathwings and Hellhounds.</p><p>In addition to their science vs. sorcery preferences, the males prefer their transitory form (resembling a cloudy humanoid) while the females prefer their true form. In their true forms, Dire Wraiths can use their barbed tongue to drill into the skull of another being and steal its memories while duplicating its physical form.</p><p>Whether they use this memory-stealing ability or not, all Wraiths can duplicate the form of virtually any living creature. Dire Wraiths are a deeply xenophobic, totally murderous evil race that is paranoid, secretive and manipulative.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822424\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4371941272431\" data-width=\"613\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 613px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822424\"><img alt=\"Wraith world being sucked into Limbo\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001.jpg 613w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001.jpg 445w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" data-width=\"445\"></a><figcaption>Wraith world being sucked into Limbo</figcaption></figure><p>The Wraith Home-world was sucked into Limbo by Rom's quick thinking.

New recruits or those whose powers proved unstable would be assigned to <a href=\"/gamma-flight/4060-41227/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41227\">Gamma Flight</a> in order to learn to properly use their powers. Those who could control their abilities but required further training formed the basis of <a href=\"/beta-flight/4060-41212/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41212\">Beta Flight</a>. The active members in the field who where tasked with dealing with any superhuman threats to the nation were in Alpha Flight.</p><p><a href=\"/guardian/4005-5047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5047\">James MacDonald Hudson</a> had the idea to form Alpha Flight after the public emergence of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and was given oversight of Department H, which was named after him. Hudson had intended that <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> be the leader of Alpha Flight. However, this task fell to Hudson himself when Wolverine was recruited by <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> to become a member of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>.</p><p>Originally using the codename Weapon Alpha, Hudson tried to bring Wolverine back to Canada and Alpha Flight by force. This led to a battle between Weapon Alpha and the X-Men. Outnumbered, Weapon Alpha was forced to retreat.</p><p>Hudson changed his codename to Vindicator after feeling responsible for injuring <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a> in the battle. Several months later, the X-Men were forced to make an emergency landing in Canada due to the magic of Alpha Flight's Shaman. Realizing something strange was happening, they were soon confronted by the full Alpha Flight team who again wished to bring Wolverine into their custody.</p><p>This first formation of Alpha Flight consisted of team leader Vindicator, <a href=\"/sasquatch/4005-1478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1478\">Sasquatch</a>, <a href=\"/shaman/4005-5017/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5017\">Shaman</a>, <a href=\"/snowbird/4005-8474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8474\">Snowbird</a>, <a href=\"/aurora/4005-3189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3189\">Aurora</a> and <a href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\">Northstar</a>. Vindicator soon learned that the government was shutting down funding of Alpha Flight.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Alpha Flight was created by <a href=\"/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\">John Byrne</a> and <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a>. Alpha Flight burst onto the pages of Marvel in 1979 with their first appearance in the <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/4050-3092/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3092\">Uncanny X-Men #120</a> as the Canadian government's soon-to-be-disbanded superhero team. Claremont was the writer, John Byrne was the penciller and <a href=\"/terry-austin/4040-4109/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4109\">Terry Austin</a> was the inker for this issue.

Only weeks prior, three members of Alpha Flight (Vindicator, Snowbird, and Shaman) along with two X-Men (Wolverine and <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>) defeated the mystical creature known as the <a href=\"/wendigo/4005-13313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13313\">Wendigo</a> in the Canadian wilderness. A week after they returned, however, the Canadian Prime Minister delivered the bad news to Hudson. Department H, the secret superhuman arm of the Canadian Ministry of Defense, was being shut down. Allowed to keep his security clearance and the electromagnetic battle suit he designed, Hudson intended to continue protecting Canada as needed without the government's help.</p><p>Shortly after arriving home, Mac received a call from Gary Cody, his former government liaison, to alert him to a mysterious phenomena in the northern wilderness. An ancient giant creature known as <a href=\"/tundra/4005-23484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23484\">Tundra</a> was being conjured back into existence and was threatening to harm <a href=\"/canada/4020-55868/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55868\">Canada</a>, so Vindicator left to investigate. Mac's wife Heather, fearing for her husband's safety out there alone went to his office and sent out a call to action to the rest of Alpha Flight through a government computer. Two members of <a href=\"/beta-flight/4060-41212/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41212\">Beta Flight</a> had been about to graduate to Alpha Flight just before they were disbanded but were not official members yet were also summoned by Heather to assist Mac. Those two team members, <a href=\"/puck/4005-5010/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5010\">Puck</a> and <a href=\"/marrina/4005-12600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12600\">Marrina</a>, became key figures within the early days of Alpha Flight. Through implanted transponders, each member heard the call and the scattered team made their way to the battle with Tundra. All but Puck that is, who couldn't arrange transportation to northern Canada. He arrived at Mac's and Heather's apartment after they had defeated Tundra. They decided to remain together as a team even without government funding. The name \"Alpha Flight\" didn't seem to make sense without Beta or <a href=\"/gamma-flight/4060-41227/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41227\">Gamma Flight</a>, but Puck insisted that he worked hard to join Alpha Flight and that's what they were going to be called. After some prompting from Shaman, Hudson also changed his codename from Vindicator to Guardian to punctuate the point that they are Canada's guardians.</p><p>Some of the former members of Beta Flight and Gamma Flight felt abandoned after Department H's disbanding and were assembled by an enemy of Mac as <a href=\"/omega-flight/4060-31159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31159\">Omega Flight</a>, Alpha Flight's opposite number. Mac was killed in an explosion during a subsequent battle while attempting to repair his damaged Guardian suit after being interrupted by Heather. Heather took Mac's death very hard, but eventually Logan and Puck convinced her that she was the right person to lead Alpha Flight. After Mac returned as part cyborg (which turned out to be a ruse), she began to wear a duplicate electromagnetic battle suit and call herself Vindicator. Eventually, the programs in Department H were taken over and perverted for evil purposes. Through deaths and resurrections, strange transformations, and sudden reversals, Alpha Flight fought on, loyal to the mission of protecting their homeland.</p><h3>The New Team</h3><p>When the original members of Alpha Flight were abducted by the alien <a href=\"/plodex/4005-9370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9370\">Plodex</a>, Sasquatch assembled a new oddball squad. The team consisted of the 97-year-old <a href=\"/centennial/4005-9369/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9369\">Centennial</a>, <a href=\"/major-mapleleaf/4005-9366/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9366\">Major Mapleleaf</a> (the son of a World War II-era hero), the deadly <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-9367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9367\">Nemesis</a>, a new <a href=\"/zuzha-yu/4005-40717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40717\">Puck</a> (the original Puck's daughter), and the mysterious <a href=\"/yukon-jack/4005-9368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9368\">Yukon Jack</a>. The newbies saved the original Alpha Flight and remained part of the team after the mission was complete.</p><h3>Death of the Team</h3><p>In the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4050-11497/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11497\">New Avengers</a> arc \"<a href=\"/new-avengers-the-collective/4050-21986/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21986\">The Collective</a>\", Alpha Flight pursued the <a href=\"/the-collective/4005-42938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42938\">Collective</a>-empowered Michael Pointer, who had destroyed his home town in Alaska. When the team confronted him, he brutally attacked them, killing almost all of them. Sasquatch was the only one who survived, and he helped form Canada's newest defense squad, <a href=\"/omega-flight/4060-31159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31159\">Omega Flight</a>.</p><h3>Chaos War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407273\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5190476190476\" data-width=\"840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407273\"><img alt=\"Chaos War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg 840w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg 631w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chaos War\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg 840w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg 631w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14493/1407273-1284756671.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chaos War</figcaption></figure><p>In Quidlivun, the Northern Gods battle the <a href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\">Chaos King</a> and his forces. <a href=\"/nelvanna/4005-22554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22554\">Nelvanna</a> sends Snowbird back to Earth moments before Nelvanna is slain by the Chaos King. In the Shattered Lands, Somon and the other <a href=\"/great-beasts/4060-15625/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15625\">Great Beasts</a> discuss the situation with Sasquatch, who has in his possession a mystical power that will enable the Great Beasts to return to Earth, for they claim that they are the only ones with the might to kill the Chaos King. Sasquatch strikes up a deal with them: the Great Beasts will return Sasquatch’s deceased friends to Earth, provided he protects the Great Beasts while they regain their strength. The Great Beasts promise not to attempt to claim Earth for themselves for one hundred years. Sasquatch accepts their deal. In Alberta, Snowbird reunites with Northstar and Aurora when they sense a strange summons to this location. Sasquatch arrives via a portal, followed by Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman and Marrina. The reunion is a joyous one, though the rest of their friends are still caught up in the chaos in the Underworlds. Snowbird explains who the Chaos King is before the slave god hordes of the Chaos King arrive. Thinking they are here for her, Snowbird battles them alongside Guardian and the twins. Sasquatch then explains to his friends the deal he made with the Great Beasts, who are now battling the slave gods. Snowbird is understandably distraught that her deadliest enemies are once more walking the Earth. Sasquatch and Snowbird debate the situation until several civilians nearby wake from their slumber having been transformed into Wendigo and join the battle against the slave gods.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1528125\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5187878787879\" data-width=\"825\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 825px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1528125\"><img alt=\"The deceased members return\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg 825w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The deceased members return\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg 825w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/1528125-attachment.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The deceased members return</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, the heroes agree that the Chaos King is the more pressing concern, so they launch into battle against the slave gods. Aurora tells Northstar that this is where they belong: with their friends, and not with the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. Snowbird witnesses one of the Great Beasts fall to the slave gods and does not help him, but when the civilians who were transformed into Wendigo begin to eat the slave gods, Snowbird, Vindicator, Shaman and Northstar reconsider the situation, deciding that they do not need anything from the Great Beasts, though it would mean the deceased Alphans will return to what is left of the Underworld. Guardian, Aurora, Sasquatch and Marrina don’t agree though, so the team briefly battles each other. Snowbird and her followers gain the upper hand, and Snowbird uses a god-like power to freeze the Great Beasts. The Chaos King then arrives and seemingly destroys them. The Wendigo return to their true civilian forms, while Vindicator asks about her daughter, to which Sasquatch reveals she is safe with family. Shaman casts a spell to return the four deceased Alphans to a state just beyond life, but it doesn’t work and he, Vindicator, Guardian and Marrina remain on Earth. Shaman realizes that <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> itself is inaccessible, and Snowbird realizes that the Great Beasts lied to Sasquatch: they had no access to their friends, there was simply nowhere else for them to go without Death. Shaman supposes that Death will be restored when the Chaos King is defeated. Sasquatch tells everyone that they have to risk defeating the Chaos King, so the eight heroes of Canada depart to join the battle against the Chaos King and save all of reality.</p><h3>Alpha Flight against the Master of the World</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3126519\" data-ratio=\"1.5227442207308\" data-width=\"1341\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1341px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3126519\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 1341w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 1260w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 420w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 1341w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 1260w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3126519-alphafl.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After the Fear Itself events, Alpha Flight had to take it up against one of their greates foes, the Master of the World. Guardian's wife Heather was brainwashed into working with The Master of the World, which caused her to fight against her own teammates. While under the Masters' influance, Heather even killed Claire's guardians, whom they where in a bitter fight against for custody since Heather and James' return from the dead! When she eventually was freed from the Masters' influance, she and her daughter fled from the law and Alpha Flight, being afraid of reprocussions. She vanished for some time. While thanks to Alpha Flight, Canada was safe once agian, it came at a great personal cost to James, whom lost his wife and daughter when they vanished.</p><p>In the meantime, James only occasianly correspondet with Alpha Flight, whom where now working in a space program.</p><h3>Alpha Flight in Space</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5723270-capmarv2017005-cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5723270\" data-ratio=\"1.5455555555556\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.6%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5723270-capmarv2017005-cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5723270\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5723270-capmarv2017005-cov.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5723270-capmarv2017005-cov.jpg 0w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5723270-capmarv2017005-cov.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5723270-capmarv2017005-cov.jpg 0w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Alpha Flight is relocated to an intergalactic space station that orbits around Earth. The team is given the task of becoming the Earth's primary defense group. Many of the team's original members joined the facility, including Sasquatch, Puck, and Aurora. The team was strengthened with U.S. officer Carol Danvers, better known as Captain Marvel.</p><p><strong>True North</strong></p><p>Many months later, Guardian tracked down Heather and Claire while seemingly helping them avert capture by the Canadian government. He brought them to a safehouse. There, Heather told James that, although she loved him, the two of them would never work. James told her he was not doing this for them to get back together and left them in the safehouse. After leaving, it turned out that the safehouse actually was a jail for them. With mental manipulation, Heather was unaware of this and felt safe. Guardian stated to his government superiors that the only reason he helped them capture Heather was on the condition that they remained unharmed. He needed Heather to trust him once again.</p><h2>Other Realities</h2><h3>Earth 1610 (Ultimate)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-387813\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.405\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-387813\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Alpha Flight\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" data-width=\"455\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Alpha Flight\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" data-width=\"455\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Alpha Flight</figcaption></figure><p>The X-men: <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler</a> and the newest X-Man, <a href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar</a>, came up against the Ultimate version of Alpha Flight.

      "deck": "A team of bounty hunters founded and originally led by Gatecrasher.",
      "description": "<p>In the Technet's first recorded exploit, they were hired by <a href=\"/sat-yr-9/4005-26530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26530\">Sat-Yr-9</a>, the Earth-794 counterpart of <a href=\"/saturnyne/4005-14813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14813\">Opal Luna Saturnyne</a>, to hunt down and bring back <a href=\"/kaptain-briton/4005-44682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44682\">Kaptain Briton</a>. Kaptain Briton fled to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\">Captain Britain</a>'s Earth, fought Captain Britain and switched costumes with him, thereby deceiving the pursuing Technet, who then mistakenly took Captain Britain prisoner. The Technet brought Captain Britain to Earth-794 where Captain Britain convinced the Technet that he was not the man they had been hired to capture, and the Technet joined Captain Britain in battling the angry Sat-Yr-9's troops. Captain Britain returned to his own Earth, where his sister, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a> had killed Kaptain Briton when he attempted to assault her.</p><p>Later the Technet went to the Wereworlds that were inhabited by people who would turrn into werewolves under a full moon. On the planet Elmo one of the members was fatally wounded and died. <a href=\"/gatecrasher/4005-14807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14807\">Gatecrasher</a> either seriously injured or killed a member of the 'Berserker Pirates' who attempted to interest her in becoming his lover. The pirate's family forced the Technet to turn over all their accumulated wealth as reparations. Angered by this reversal in their fortunes, all of the members of the Technet except for <a href=\"/yap/4005-14818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14818\">Yap</a> and Fascination, later known as <a href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-23441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23441\">Scatterbrain</a>, left the team.</p><p>Gatecrasher then went to a celebration held by the despot of Kandahar. A person she believed to be the despot himself hired her to procure a perfect mathematical model of the universe that was made of rock crystal and that was held and revered by the Incas of 14th century Peru on Earth-616. Gatecrasher, Yap, and Fascination journeyed through time to obtain the model, but Gatecrasher and Yap were tricked by the person they believed to be a native high priest into consuming fruit filled with the eggs of deadly parasites. Gatecrasher and Yap were thus forced to remain under a cooling waterfall to prevent the eggs inside them from hatching and consuming their bodies from within. In actuality, an alien had impersonated both the despot of Kandahar and the high priest, and hoped to force Fascination into his employ through this convoluted plot. This alien had already succeeded in hiring the members of the Technet who had just left the group. His team was the Special Executive, a future version of the Technet. The team's precognitive told him that Fascination wouldn't join the Special Executive for another 300 hundred years.</p><p>Fascination brought Captain Britain and his companion <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/meggan/4005-7604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7604\">Meggan</a> to 14th century Peru to rescue Gatecrasher. Captain Britain gathered together the plants necessary to create the antidote that would kill the parasite eggs. Gatecrasher and Yap consumed the antidote, and then they, Fascination, Captain Britain, and Meggan returned to their own time period.</p><p>Gatecrasher recruited new members <a href=\"/numbers/4005-23440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23440\">Numbers</a> and <a href=\"/waxworks/4005-14817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14817\">Waxworks</a> and all the former members except Elmo rejoined.</p><p>Opal Luna Saturnyne hired the Technet to capture <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rachel-grey/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers</a> who, according to Saturnyne, was a threat to the universe. At the time Rachel was on the run from <a href=\"/mojo/4005-6755/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6755\">Mojo</a> who had enslaved her to star in his movies and had sent the warwolves after her.The Warwolves and the Technet fought over Rachel and during the fight, <a href=\"/ferro-2/4005-23487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23487\">Ferro 2</a> was killed. Rachel was saved by Captain Britain, Meggan, and her fellow X-Men <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a>. Together they fought off the Technet, with Gatecrasher feeling for her life, who then retreated. This battle against the Technet led directly to the formation of the team <a href=\"/excalibur/4060-14864/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14864\">Excalibur</a> by Summers and her allies. It was later revealed that Saturnyne had hired the Technet under orders of Roma, who needed to form the superhero team to save the multiverse.</p><p>The Technet were allowed to stay in Brighton, England, where they would use their alien technology to provide the city with sunny weather. Meanwhile they would plot to capture Rachel Summers and regain their honor. During this time, they were hired by Sat-Yr-9, who had taken the identity of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/courtney-ross/4005-3431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3431\">Courtney Ross</a>. The Technet were hired to free <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jamie-braddock/4005-4270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4270\">Jamie Braddock</a>. They succeeded in their task, but Jamie was taken by Ross and the Technet's memories of their mission were wiped. Gatecrasher then constructed Hardboiled Henry, a living bomb, to ambush Excalibur. The plan succeeded and the Technet nearly defeated Excalibur, but agents of Saturnyne interfered. The Technet received a holographic message from Saturnyne, telling them that they were permanently exiled to Earth-616 and that the bounty on Phoenix was canceled. Furious the Technet turned on Gatecrasher, but Gatecrasher and Yap teleported away. The Technet begged Excalibur for asylum and Nightcrawler told his teammates to accept. The former Technet repaired the damage done by Hardboiled Henry to Excalibur's home. During these repairs Numbers met the dragon living in Excalibur's basement and fell in love with her. The British government came to Excalibur's home for help against an invisible, murderous creature, but only Nightcrawler was home, nursing a broken leg. Nightcrawler trained the aliens to become the N-men and they managed to destroy the creature, but Joyboy disappeared during this mission. Shortly afterward the Special Executive appeared on Earth and told the N-men that they had predicted Earth's destruction to happen within the next few hours. They offered the N-men a job. The N-men agreed and teleported away, together with Numbers, the dragon and their newly born children.</p><p>Excaliber were able to prevent Earth's destruction and found <a href=\"/joyboy/4005-14815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14815\">Joyboy</a> with the <a href=\"/crazy-gang/4060-14821/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14821\">Crazy Gang</a>. Here Joyboy had formed a psychic bond with the Crazy Gang's <a href=\"/red-queen/4005-23003/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23003\">Red Queen</a>, using his powers to distort her nightmares and form a beautiful land. During this time, Gatecrasher began to go insane, seeing images of Hardboiled Henry, who accused her of making his death meaningless.</p><p>The Technet later reappeared. In this appearance Gatecrasher was the leader once more and Joyboy and Hardboiled Henry had returned as well. <a href=\"/roma/14810/\">Roma</a> had hired them to capture <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a>. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and the Roma came to a agreement and Technet disappeared. </p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>X-Men</h3><p>All members of Technet were seen in <a href=\"/x-men-the-animated-series-404-proteus-part-1/4070-445/\" data-ref-id=\"4070-445\">Proteus, Part 1</a>.<i><br /></i></p>",

When the world sees the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>'s death broadcasted worldwide, no-one knows about their reincarnation, least of all their fellow teammates: <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Marvel Girl</a> (then Phoenix II), and <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>. Because of this, they join <a href=\"/meggan/4005-7604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7604\">Meggan</a> and <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\">Captain Britain</a> to form Excalibur. Their base of operations was inside Captain Britain's home, a lighthouse.</p><p>The first adventure in their own title involved the <a href=\"/warwolves/4060-59543/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59543\">Warwolves</a>, a group of alien creatures which resemble metallic werewolves. They collect human skins and wear them as disguises. In this adventure, they had come to earth looking for the skin of Phoenix, but in a mix up at the train station Shadowcat was captured. Her phasing powers complicated their plot, but soon enough the rest of Excalibur arrived to help. This event was the beginning of Excalibur.</p><p>Excalibur took on a more light-hearted tone then the rest of the X-titles. Some of their other early adventures include run ins with villains from both X-Men continuities (like Juggernaut) and also incorporated elements and enemies from Captain Britain's Marvel UK adventures (like <a href=\"/gatecrasher/4005-14807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14807\"> Gatecrasher</a> and <a href=\"/saturnyne/4005-14813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14813\"> Saturnyne</a>). One example is a fight that broke out between Captain Britain and <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\"> Juggernaut</a>. There is also the <a href=\"/crazy-gang/4060-14821/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14821\"> Crazy Gang</a>, which was temporarily ran by <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\"> Arcade</a> and his <a href=\"/murderworld/4020-41963/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41963\"> Murderworld</a>. More importantly; after a Cross-Time portal opens Excalibur meets many new enemies such as the Lightning Force, an alternate version of Excalibur from Earth-597. Some early themes of the book revolved around each member having issues with their powers.</p><p>The team eventually learns (through <a href=\"/merlyn/4005-14820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14820\">Merlyn</a>'s manipulations) that <a href=\"/roma/4005-14810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14810\">Roma</a>, their supposed guardian, set up all the events surrounding their formation. All leading up to Excalibur fighting and defeating Necrom and the Anti-Phoenix.</p><p>Beginning with issue #71, the creative team decided to more closely associate Excalibur with the mainstream X-Men books. With the team pared down to just Shadowcat, Nightcrawler and Phoenix (the rest of the team indisposed for various reasons), they moved Excalibur's base of operations to Moira's MacTaggart's <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\">Muir Island</a>. Excalibur then filled out its ranks with other X-men characters (such as <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a> and <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>) as well as bringing Captain Britain (as the mad Brittanic) and Meggan back to the fold.</p><p>The team eventually disbanded to the winds after the wedding of Brian Braddock and Meggan (mostly to facilitate Colossus, Nightcrawler and Shadowcat's return to the X-Men).</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Excalibur was originally created by <a href=\"/alan-davis/4040-2348/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2348\"> Alan Davis</a>, <a href=\"/paul-neary/4040-9570/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9570\"> Paul Neary</a>, and the renowned X-Men writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\"> Chris Claremont</a>. Alan Davis and Paul Neary won an Eisner award for \"Best Comic Book art Team\" in 1989 during their Excalibur stint.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Original Excalibur</h3><p>Excalibur was formed in Britain, and was composed of British super-heroes <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\"> Captain Britain</a> and <a href=\"/meggan/4005-7604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7604\"> Meggan</a> as well as the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a>'s <a href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\"> Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\"> Kitty Pryde</a>, <a href=\"/lockheed/4005-4444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4444\"> Lockheed</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\"> Nightcrawler</a>, and a new character <a href=\"/widget/4005-14809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14809\"> Widget</a>.

Although he was happy to see her, their reunion was cut short by the news that <a href=\"/dazzler/1498/\" data-ref-id=\"1498\"> Dazzler</a> was attacked and was presumed dead. Upon arrival the group was able to revive her and quickly learned that she was attacked by a group of original X-Men doppelgangers. They learned that these X-Men were from another dimension, and the evil Charles Xavier's mind had been taken over by that dimension's <a href=\"/shadow-king/14889/\" data-ref-id=\"14889\"> Shadow King</a>. Psylocke was able to help defeat the Shadow King, and the X-Men doubles are still in custody.</p><p>The team was brought back in time by the original Black Night in order to save <a href=\"/camelot/4020-55788/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55788\"> King Arthur's Camelot</a>. With the assistance of Excalibur, <a href=\"/merlin/4005-39132/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39132\"> Merlin</a> was able to defeat a pack of dragons that threatened Camelot's existence.</p><p>After nearly being beaten by the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/4060-18519/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18519\"> Wrecking Crew</a>, <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\"> Juggernaut</a> is feeling less powerful than ever. In an attempt to regain some of his former glory, Juggernaut set out for the <a href=\"/temple-of-cyttorak/4020-42362/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42362\"> Temple of Cyttorak</a> to reclaim the <a href=\"/crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/4055-41533/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41533\"> Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a>, the source of his power as the Juggernaut. The rest of Excalibur followed behind. Closing in on the temple, the team had to deal with their feelings for each other as Cyttorak's power brought out negative emotions between them. This included <a href=\"/nocturne/4005-4565/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4565\"> Nocturne</a> confronting Dazzler about the way she treated the Juggernaut, revealing Nocturne's feelings for the Juggernaut. After battling his inner demons, Juggernaut and the rest of Excalibur returned to England. While this was a momentary victory for Juggernaut, he brought the gem back not yet knowing what he was going to do with it. The Black Night also left the team to try to uncover the secrets of his sword.</p><p>Nocturne had a stroke. After weeks of hospitalization and rehabilitation, she still struggled to regain the use of her body and mind. With the team's support, Nocturne found the strength to continue trying to reclaim what she used to take for granted. This experience was hard on the team as such an ailment reminded them of their mortality.</p><h3><strong>Dawn of X</strong></h3><p>Years later, Betsy Braddock returned as Captain Britain, and along with <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a>, <a href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit</a>, <a href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\">Jubilee</a>, <a href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\">Rictor</a> and the former supervillain <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">En Sabah Nur</a>, reformed the Excalibur team.

As Excalibur lay in deep slumber, Rachel Summers has a shocking dream depicting her brother through her psychic link. Suddenly, without a moments hesitation, she pounces out of bed and flies directly out of the <a href=\"/excalibur-lighthouse/4020-56501/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56501\"> Excalibur Lighthouse</a>, leaving a gaping hole in the roof. The other members wake up; startled with the noise. Kitty Pryde, Rachel's roommate, attempts to recover from Rachel's uniform psychic attack as she informs the rest of Excalibur what she suspected. Soon, the team had left the Lighthouse, in search of their fellow teammate.</p><p>As Excalibur approached <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\"> New York City</a>, they realized something was very wrong. The sky had changed colour, with dark shadows crossing the sky. After they reached the City, the team split up. Meggan was caught by <a href=\"/nastirh/4005-42869/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42869\"> N'astirh</a>, and therefore transformed into the Goblin Princess. Rachel on the other hand, after being over thrown by a pack of <a href=\"/limbo-demons/4060-31912/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31912\"> 'Limbo Demons'</a>, is suddenly transformed into some sort of 'Plastic Bride.' She is then captured by the demon <a href=\"/crotus/4005-29343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29343\"> Crotus</a>, a lowly creature who has finally caught a break. He takes Rachel to the 'Demon Priest,' where they prepare for their <a href=\"/excalibur-goblin-morn/4000-31100/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-31100\"> marriage</a>. Nightcrawler is having a bit more luck. He had managed to stay away from the heavy demon attacks, but he instead reflects on his powers. He notices that many objects and places in the city are changing. A great example is the car that grows teeth, and a hunger to go with them. This \"Demon Car\" attempts to eat a crowd of civilians, and Nightcrawler breaks into a fight. As he finished this battle, he finds more inanimate objects becoming alive. This time, a pack of creepy Mannequins.</p><p>Kitty Pryde however is not by herself. She and Captain Britain were together as the local theater came alive! Out of nowhere reels of film were flying about the street, sucking innocents inside, as well as Kitty and Cap. Inside the theater they find a warped reality, with Meggan, the <a href=\"/meggan/4005-7604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7604\"> Goblin Princess</a> behind it. Meggan, (possibly subconsciously because of Captain Britain's current behavior) plays with Captain Britain, taunting him. Kitty is rather left alone by Meggan, but is however treated to other horrors. But in this tangible world, Kitty figures out she can control it, and therefore summons <a href=\"/soulsword/4055-42991/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42991\"> Illyana Rasputin's Soulsword</a>! With this she defeats Meggan and saves Captain Britain.</p><p>Soon the events of Inferno are finished, and the team return to normal, although they find that their powers are now getting weaker.</p><h3><strong>Cross-Time Caper</strong></h3><p>The <a href=\"/cross-time-caper/4045-52604/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-52604\"> Cross-Time Caper</a> occurred when Widget unexpectedly activated himself and transported the Excalibur team and their train across into an alternate world. It was one in which the magic of the earth was very high, leading to Meggan and Captain Britain's powers returning to full capacity. A young knight, <a href=\"/prince-william/4005-29154/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29154\"> Prince William</a>, sees Shadowcat unconscious and thinks the worst when he sees Lockheed, her pet dragon. When the rest of Excalibur arrives the problem is resolved, but the boy is left with a huge crush on Shadowcat. He therefore asks for her hand. She refuses, but is then taken away and 'transformed' into a real princess. The rest of the team are left on their own, and soon find the prince's real match. After that their train is fixed and they 'jump' on to another world.</p><p>Excalibur then finds themselves in a world similar to their own, but with one small difference. The heroes all seem to be insane and run around fighting each other, killing one another in the blink of an eye. When Galactus sees this, he is outraged, and decides it is best if the world is destroyed as it is to silly. The team just get out before the world collapses.</p><p>We soon find out about the Bounty hunter Gatecrasher and her band of Mercenaries, <a href=\"/technet/4060-14693/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14693\"> Technet</a>. They have been sent to earth to find, and capture Phoenix. Unfortunately, she is not there, (she, along with the rest of Excalibur are travelling through alternate dimensions) and with fear of failing her boss, the Technet stay and wait for the Phoenix.</p><p>As we travel to another realm, we see a new situation. The team has been split up, all landing somewhere else. Nightcrawler is on a ship and ends up with a beautiful woman who is by herself. Soon though, space pirates attack the ship and Nightcrawler, thinking that he is helping knocks out the boss. It turns out that she was the heir to the ship after her father died. Nightcrawler is left in a sticky situation, and the rest of the team are not better off!</p><p>Soon, once again the team is transported to an alternate dimension, one in which everyone is constantly racing. The world is the race track and the sport is everything. We also see Jamie Braddock and his mysterious, reality warping powers. This leads to a disturbing sequence involving Meggan and Phoenix changing bodies.</p><p>After we see Jamie Braddock's powers in the alternate dimension, we also see them in the original. It seems that he is controlling his alternate self in a plot to capture the team. Meggan tries to fight him in the alternate world and transforms into different X-Men. In all the confusion Shadowcat enters a portal leading back home, where she is cut off from the team for a long time.</p><p>The others stories we see include a world where Iron Man is Evil, and works for the Shadow King. And another in which Illyana Rasputin's Demon side is shown greatly; in a world where super-humans are hunted and captured. This was committed by a group led by none other than the alternate version of Captain Britain and his sister Psylocke.</p><p>The Cross-Time Caper eventually ended when they were given assistance by an overseer who was fed up with all of the cross-time damage they were responsible for.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-597</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925102\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48250/925102-lightning_force.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.56\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48250/925102-lightning_force.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925102\"><img alt=\"Lightning Force\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/48250/925102-lightning_force.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/48250/925102-lightning_force.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Force\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/48250/925102-lightning_force.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/48250/925102-lightning_force.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Force</figcaption></figure><p>In this reality the Excalibur team was known as the <a href=\"/lightning-force/4060-56919/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56919\">Lightning Force</a>.

      "deck": "The Starjammers are a group of space pirates. They were formerly led by Christopher Summers alias Corsair, then by his son Havok.",
      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Ever since <a href=\"/corsair/4005-7591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7591\">Christopher Summers</a> was a boy, he loved the adventures of the swashbuckling heroes of old novels and movies. Even as a major in the United States Air Force, he chose the call sign \"Corsair\" in homage to them. Chosen for the space program, he hoped he would soon travel into space. He got his wish, but not in the way he would have wanted.</p><p>Following a visit to his parents in Anchorage, Alaska, Major Summers was flying his wife, <a href=\"/katherine-summers/4005-15328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15328\">Katherine Summers</a>, and his sons, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Scott</a> (a.k.a. Cyclops) and <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Alex</a> (a.k.a. Havok), down the Pacific coast in his private plane when they were attacked by a <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a> starship. Scott and Alex parachuted to safety, but Major Summers and his wife were teleported aboard the starship and taken back to the Shi'ar throneworld. Their last view of their sons was of their parachute on fire, and they assumed their children had perished.</p><p>Christopher was imprisoned but escaped only to find Emperor <a href=\"/dken/4005-40902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40902\">D'Ken</a> attempting to force himself on Katherine. They fought and in the scuffle D'Ken murdered Katherine before Summers' eyes and then sentenced him to the mines of the planet Alsibar. Unknown to Christopher, Katherine was pregnant at the time of her death. This fetus was harvested and aged to adolescence in an incubation chamber. The resulting child, <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Gabriel</a> (a.k.a. Vulcan), was raised as a slave of the Shi'ar. After escaping the mines of Alsibar, Corsair and his fellow escaped slaves began a life of piracy in opposition of D'Ken's rule.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Starjammers were created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/4040-4447/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4447\">Dave Cockrum</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a href=\"/x-men/4050-2133/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2133\">X-Men</a> # 107.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Prison Breakout</h3><p>Slowly, Christopher Summers' spirit was broken. This changed when he witnessed some guards viciously beating a fellow slave—a female, catlike alien named <a href=\"/hepzibah/4005-13868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13868\">Hepzibah</a>. Outraged, Summers attacked the guards. Two more of his fellow prisoners—<a href=\"/chod/4005-40789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40789\">Ch'od</a> and <a href=\"/raza/4005-13869/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13869\">Raza Longknife</a>—came to his assistance.</p><p>Together, the four stole a spaceship and escaped. Summers took the name Corsair and called his new band of outlaws the Starjammers, sharing their name with <a href=\"/the-starjammer/4055-55842/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55842\">the ship they'd stolen</a>. They became rebels and pirates, revenging themselves on the Sh'ar by attacking their spacecraft.</p><h3>Meeting the X-Men</h3><p>The Starjammers helped the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> to stop the Shi'ar Emperor D'Ken's attempt to destroy the universe with the <a href=\"/mkraan-crystal/4055-44426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44426\">M'Kraan Crystal</a>. In gratitude, Lilandra unofficially put an end to the feud between the Empire and the Starjammers. After she was overthrown by <a href=\"/deathbird/4005-6089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6089\">Deathbird</a>, <a href=\"/lilandra/4005-6144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6144\">Lilandra</a> found refuge with the team until she regained the Shi'ar throne.</p><p>Now aware that his two eldest sons survived their crash, Corsair developed a distant but emotional relationship with Scott and Alex, although he remained in space due to his responsibilities with the Starjammers.</p><h3>Corsair's Legacy</h3><p>After Corsair's death at the hands of his youngest son and new Emperor of the Shi'ar, Vulcan. A new group of Starjammers were born determined to bring justice to Vulcan and return Lilandra to her throne as the true Shi'ar Empress. Corsair's second son, Havok, took his father's mantle as leader of the Starjamers. He was accompanied by <a href=\"/rachel-grey/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Grey</a> (a.k.a. Marvel Girl), Corsair's granddaughter from an alternate timeline, as well as by <a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Lorna Dane</a> (a.k.a. Polaris). Also on the crew were <a href=\"/korvus/4005-41208/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41208\">Korvus</a>, <a href=\"/creee/4005-10304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10304\">Creee</a>, and <a href=\"/sikorsky/4005-14831/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14831\">Sikorsky</a>.</p><h3>Emperor Vulcan</h3><p>Under Havok's leadership the Starjammers use guerrilla tactics against the Emperor's forces while gathering more military forces loyal to the before exiled General <a href=\"/kaardum/4005-58928/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58928\">Ka'Ardum</a> of the Shi'ar Military in effort to even the battle against Vulcan and his military forces who also has the Imperial Guard on his side.</p><p>They however in the middle of an important battle against Vulcan himself who had amassed his own military power where forced to deal with a new very destructive threat intent on destroying the Shi'ar with an incredibly powerful weapon. This brought about the temporary cease fire between the Summer's brothers thus the Starjammers and the Shi'ar till it was dealt with.</p><p>Vulcan however as soon as their mutual enemy was dealt with seized the weapon for his own use and turned on the Starjammers but Havok destroyed the weapon thou not before Vulcan and his Imperial Guard managed to capture both the crew and their ship. With only Marvel Girl, Korvus and Lilandra escaping as they are betrayed by General Ka'Ardum who decides to switch allegiance and sides with Emperor Vulcan.</p><h3>King Breaker</h3><p>Vulcan ships the four Starjammers to a new underwater prison, The Hole, on the planet Kr'nn and proceeds to try and break them over the course of months using various means available to him but remains unsuccessful.</p><p>The three remaining free Starjammers in the meantime try to find the location of the rest of their crew while managing to retrieve their ship. They eventually manage to get the answer from Gladiator though. Before they could break them out, they encounter a new set of more ruthless Imperial Guards Vulcan has sent to kill them.</p><p>On Kr'nn, Havok frees first himself and his crew and proceed to get control over the prison. Deciding to make a stand right there when Vulcan returns as he has been doing frequently since their capture. The other three eventually join up there with the intent of rescuing them when the new Imperial Guard members meet up with them for battle they lose Raza to <a href=\"/zzzxx/4005-59546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59546\">ZZZXX</a> and shortly after are joined by other Imperial Guards including Vulcan and Deathstrike.</p><p>The Starjammers put up a fierce battle unintentionally aided by Gladiator who upon seeing his fellow Strontian who is on the other Imperial Guard team immediately skips the Starjammers and battles her instead. Both Rachel and Korvus mid-battle loose their Phoenix powers that suddenly leaves them. Deathbird attacks Lilandra intent on killing her sister ends up getting impaled by the dethroned impress wounding her critically.</p><p>Havok having absorbed the <a href=\"/hodinn/4005-59512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59512\">Hodinn</a>, an Imperial Guard who is made up of a star, uses this power boost to fight Vulcan to the point where he is about to kill Vulcan when Polaris, who has been holding the ceiling from collapsing on them after it was compromised by the Hodinn and Marvel Girls crash entry, states she can no longer hold the ceiling and Lilandra orders an emergency teleport evacuation for her team despite Havok's protest and once aboard the Starjammer the ship makes a quick getaway heading straight to the Kree homeworld, Hala.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>The Starjammers are followed by the Shi'ar all their way to Kree Space where the exiled Lilandra intends to seek audience with the Kree's new King, the Inhuman Blackbolt to grant her asylum from Emperor Vulcan.</p><p>During the Royal wedding between the Kree, Ronan the Accuser and the Inhuman, Crystal. Vulcan's Imperial Guard strike fast and hard before teleporting out. The Starjammers are quick to counter attack but are blitzed and Lilandra is captured, Ch'od looses his hand when trying to stop them from taking her.</p><p>The Starjammers however are quick to go after her from the clutches of the Shi'ar. They accompanied by the new Inhuman Elite strike and board a Shi'ar vessel to retrieve information on her location and proceed to go after them. They encounter the faction of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> sent out as an envoy to meet with Emperor Vulcan and quickly take them along to retrieve Lilandra. The Starjammers together with the Guardians drop in on the Shi'ar ship bring Lilandra back to the Shi'ar Throneworld where she is to stand trial.</p><p>They are quick to engage the Imperial Guard as they board where Rachel aiding Rocket Raccoon gets the drop on Gladiator till he sees through their trick and proceeds to quickly defeat the two teams but then after Lilandra pleads with him he seems to turn on the Imperial Guards and killing one of them in the process.</p><p>Members Korvus and Rachel Summers of the Starjammers than suddenly lose their connection to the Phoenix Force during a battle. Havok than leads the Starjammers back to Earth because of this but Ch'od and Raza Longknife stay behind.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animated</h3><h4><a href=\"/xmen-the-animated-series/4075-26/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-26\">X-Men: The Animated Series</a></h4><p>The Starjammers appeared during the Phoenix Saga episodes.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The Purifiers were originally disciples of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\" href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" slug=\"william-stryker\">Reverend William Stryker</a>, whose agenda is based on an extreme version of Christian fundamentalism.

Using knowledge of the future gained from the Sentinel's memory system Stryker also saved several human lives, and suggested those incidences were \"miracles\". This enabled him to re-energize support for the Purifiers, and he recruited many new members.</p><p>In the wake of M-Day, and the decimation of the mutant population, Stryker and his forces engaged in brutal attacks on the remaining mutants. Their belief was that God did his part on M-Day, and that it was their job to finish his work by killing the rest. Among their victims were junior X-Men, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40535\" href=\"/wallflower/4005-40535/\" slug=\"wallflower\">Wallflower</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9739\" href=\"/icarus/4005-9739/\" slug=\"icarus\">Icarus</a>, the former of which was killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47984\" href=\"/matthew-risman/4005-47984/\" slug=\"matthew-risman\">Matthew Risman</a>.

The <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a> are the primary team, and then there are many offshoots such as <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\"> X-Factor</a> and the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a>. Generation X formed in 1994 and it changed the formula for the X-books in several ways.

Despite (or because of) these changes in formula, Generation X proved to be very successful. Also, Generation X didn't initially identify themselves as such until later in the book.</p><p>They trained at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters (later renamed back to its historic <a href=\"/massachusetts-academy/4020-47788/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47788\"> Massachusetts Academy</a> name when Xavier's got some bad press) and had a Danger Grotto (also known as the Biosphere or the Grotto for short) made from <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\"> Shi'ar</a> technology and bits of <a href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\"> Krakoa</a> the Living Island.

Soon, Sean gained complete control over his inheritance; winning his cousin's share in a dice game. Sean later became an Interpol agent and also got married to Maeve Rourke.

Sean returned and was devastated from his wife's death and also livid at Tom for not taking care of Maeve. Sean knocked him into a chasm that broke his leg. Tom was vengeful, and promised to get revenge on Sean by never telling him about his daughter.</p><p>Sean left Interpol (<a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a> screwed up a mission of his), and went freelance. Sean was discovered by <a href=\"/factor-three/4060-15409/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15409\"> Factor Three</a>, a villain team, and their leader <a href=\"/changeling/4005-12636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12636\"> Changeling</a> invited him to join.

He was forced to do their bidding, by a handful of explosives they had placed on him.

She joined the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a>, and started to training five telepathic quintuplets, the <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\"> Stepford Cuckoos</a>.

During this same period, the organization began a significant campaign against mutants, capturing members of both the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> and their foes, like the <a href=\"/blob/4005-3182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3182\">Blob</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/unus-the-untouchable/4005-3438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3438\">Unus the Untouchable</a>. This iteration of the Empire fell after Captain America defeated their operative, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nefarius/4005-34781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34781\">Moonstone</a>, and their White House connection committed suicide.

Ruckus believes himself to be above the law, and tries to show off this superiority at every chance he gets; he once hit a grocery store, severely wounded the store clerk and blasted his way through police just to get some free beer.</p><h4><u>Gorgeous George</u></h4><p>A mutant whose body is composed of an unspecified semi-solid, tar-like substance. In effect, George possesses limited shape-shifting powers enabling him to elongate, inflate, or open holes into his body at will. His semi-solid form gives George a certain degree of resistance to physical harm. Like the other members of The Nasty Boys, not much has been revealed regarding the early life and origin of Gorgeous George. Incidentally, he once got so drunk that he forgot how long his arms were supposed to be.</p><p><b><u>Hairbag</u></b></p><p>He was recruited by Mister Sinister and possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, hyper-keen senses, and resistance to injury. His body is covered in fur and he has razor sharp fangs and claws, as well as flexible hair follicles. During altercations with X-Factor, Hairbag often fought against <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a>, his opposite. In the Nasty Boys' final fight, Hairbag was captured along with his teammate Slab and taken to a holding cell by X-Factor. While waiting for his lawyer to negotiate bail, Hairbag and Slab were broken out of prison by the <a href=\"/mutant-liberation-front/4060-28349/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28349\">Mutant Liberation Front</a>. and returned to the Nasty Boys shortly afterwards. In the cartoon, Hairbag has poisonous breath and can eject his hair like a porcupine.</p><p><b><u>Ramrod</u></b></p><p>He can psionically control wood and plants. He always carries with him a staff of wood in order to make certain that he has something to use his powers on should the need arise. He is also an illegal immigrant in the United States. Unlike the other Nasty Boys, Ramrod did not appear in the TV series.</p><p><b><u>Slab</u></b></p><p>He is the team's resident powerhouse, able to increase his size and thereby boost his strength and durability. Slab was the first of the Nasty Boys to appear.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>X-Men: The Animated Series</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37573/1457276-ren21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1457276\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37573/1457276-ren21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1457276\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/37573/1457276-ren21.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37573/1457276-ren21.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/37573/1457276-ren21.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>The Nasty Boysappeared in a few episodes of the series <strong>Reunion, Part 1 &amp; 2</strong> <i>(Episode 25 &amp; 26)</i> they were henchmen for Mr. Sinister.</p>",

      "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a> <h2>Gene Nation</h2> <p><strong>First Incarnation</strong></p> <p>When the mentally unstable Mikhail Rasputin flooded the Morlock tunnels, many were believed dead. However, at the last instant Mikhail used his powers to open a portal into a parallel dimension dubbed The Hill. In this dimension, time moves at a faster rate, and even though it was a matter of months in the main <em>Marvel Universe</em>, it had been between 10-20 years In the Hill. On the anniversary of the Mutant Massacre, a horrific event in which Mr. Sinister's henchmen the Marauders killed many Morlocks, the members of Gene Nation reappeared in the main universe ( Earth-616). Their mission was to destroy one human for every Morlock life that was lost, and also, in a side mission performed by Hemingway and Marrow, to kill some of the original Morlocks. In Marrow's eyes, Leech, one of the few to survive the massacre, was weak and instead of defending his people he hid like a coward. Fortunately, the White Queen, who was trying to recruit Leech to her teenage mutant team Generation X, is able to thwart their efforts. However, with the intervention of the Dark Beast Marrow and Hemingway escape. Afterwards, a team of X-Men and the Morlock Callisto confront an attack group from Gene Nation including Marrow, Hemingway, Reverb, Sack, and Vessel. In order to assure that their mission succeeds, Marrow alerts the X-Men that she has a bomb strapped to her heart. Seeing it as the only way of stopping the terrorist, Storm rips out Marrow's heart. Callisto takes the remaining members of Gene Nation back to The Hill. A few months later, Storm is kidnapped by Mikhail and taken to The Hill. Once there she has to fight her way to the top of the hill where Mikhail lives, where she successfully overpowers him. Having won the victory, Storm forces Mikhail to take all of the people living on The Hill back to the real world. In an effort to give the mutants a new start, she settles them in a village outside of her home town in Africa. Unfortunately this village is later attacked by anti-mutant extremists and many members of Gene Nation are murdered. However, they wouldn't get much of a chance to start over because shortly after they were placed in Africa the Dark Beast gathers some of the original members, along with some new recruits, to form a new team. The express purpose of this team is to capture test subjects for the evil genius, namely the students of Generation X. They succeed in capturing all but the White Queen and the newcomer Gaia and, with the help of Nate Grey, also known as X-Man, they liberate her charges.<br/><br/><strong>Weapon X: Days of Future Now</strong></p> <p>In the five-issue miniseries Weapon X: Days of Future Now, on Earth-5700 in an alternate future of our own timeline, Gene Nation appears in issue #4 twenty-four years in the future when Magneto assembles the various teams of the world in the face of a common threat: the Sentinels.</p> <p><strong>Members</strong></p> <p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li><strong>Charm</strong> - heightened strength, agility, and reflexes </li> <li><strong>Hemingway</strong> - can greatly increase his size and mass, also has bone spikes protruding from his back and forearms that can be used offensively </li> <li><strong>Loss</strong> - razor sharp bone spikes on her wrists </li> <li><strong>Marrow</strong> - heightened bone growth causes them to grow beyond her body where they can be removed and used as weapons, also an increased healing ability to seal the holes made by the removal of bones </li> <li><strong>Reverb</strong> - project his psychic talents into the environment around him, giving him an uncanny awareness of his surroundings, also uses his abilities to mentally cripple others </li> <li><strong>Sack</strong> - semi-liquid form allows him to encase the bodies of others in a clear membrane that allows him to control that person until they asphyxiate </li> <li><strong>Vessel</strong> - absorbs the \"souls\" of the recently deceased to increase his size, strength, and invulnerability </li></ul> <p>Note: Callisto showed a video to the X-Men about Gene Nation that showed Ever as a member; however he never made an appearance with them.

Likewise, since almost every Marvel character were zombified, only the central characters should be listed as members here.</b></i></p><h2><span><b><span>Overview</span></b></span></h2><p>In an alternate version of the main <a href=\"/marvel-multiverse/4020-45892/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45892\">Marvel Universe</a> most of earths heroes have been infected with a virus that has turned them into <a href=\"/zombies/4060-44930/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44930\">zombies</a>. A paradoxical loop involving a Zombie Sentry is considered the origin of its existence in the main series seen in the <a href=\"/marvel-zombies/4050-19252/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19252\">Marvel Zombies</a>. <a href=\"/marvel-zombies-5/4050-32451/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32451\"><br /></a></p><p>The contagion passes via a bite from an infected being. Marvel Zombies have similar characteristics to <a href=\"/zombies/4060-44930/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44930\">zombies</a>, except the retain their intelligence, personality and special abilities. The disease causes a powerful hunger which can only be satisfied by ingesting the flesh of the living. If they eat the flesh of other zombies it causes them to become ill. The hunger affects the self control and intelligence, the hungrier they are, the less rational and intelligent they are. Once fed, their original personalities re-emerge along with their intelligence.</p><p>The disease seems to be almost 100% infectious, with both <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> and the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, individuals normally highly resistant or immune to most diseases, being affected. However, those with any kind of accelerated healing appear to be able to fend off the disease longer. The disease is also shown to affect the gods of Asgard and <a href=\"/gods-of-olympus/4060-57401/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57401\">Olympus</a> as well. The only ones that appear to be immune are the already zombified <a href=\"/zombie/4005-13797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13797\">Simon Garth</a>, who while infected cannot spread the virus, and non-organic mechanical beings, such as <a href=\"/jocasta/4005-3318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3318\">Jocasta</a>, <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> and <a href=\"/machine-man/4005-7242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7242\">Machine Man</a>. <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Uatu</a> and the <a href=\"/the-watchers/4060-11523/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11523\">Watchers</a>, due to their having exchanged corporeal bodies for forms of pure energy long ago, are also immune to the virus.</p><p>The disease is incredibly hard to stop once spreading, due to the high survival rate of all zombies. Zombies seem to only need their brain stem to survive and can continue living without any use of their organs or limbs. The infection even allows severed heads to continue speech. This was witnessed by <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>, <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>, and <a href=\"/zombie-deadpool/4005-33654/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33654\">Headpool</a> who were decapitated heads. Another example is <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> who survived for over forty years as a brain until being put inside the body of <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>'s dead son.</p><p>The contagion has an addiction element and if a victim can be isolated from a food supply, within a couple of weeks the cravings disappear and the subject is able perform a functioning role within society. Any additional ingestion of flesh will restore the hunger.</p><h2><span>Creation</span></h2><p>Marvel Zombies were created by <a href=\"/mark-millar/4040-40805/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40805\">Mark Millar</a> and <a href=\"/greg-land/4040-2064/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2064\">Greg Land</a> who wrote two story arcs of <a href=\"/ultimate-fantastic-four/4050-10379/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-10379\">Ultimate Fantastic Four</a> titled \"Crossover\" and \"Frightful\".

      "description": "<p>China Force is a team of Government agents that were given artificially enhanced powers and costumes based on the animals from the Chinese zodiac. At one point they had twelve agents representing each animal from the Chinese zodiac but majority defected or were killed. The only four operatives remaining were <a href=\"/rat/4005-54034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54034\">Rat</a>, <a href=\"/ox/4005-54035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54035\">Ox</a>, <a href=\"/rabbit/4005-54038/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54038\">Rabbit</a> and <a href=\"/snake/4005-54036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54036\">Snake</a>. The Chinese government would send China Force to Ottawa so they could bring back home a former operative named <a href=\"/jade-dragon/4005-10956/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10956\">Dei Guan</a> aka <a href=\"/jade-dragon/4005-10956/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10956\">Jade Dragon</a> because they believed he was a traitor and defected from their homeland. China Force would kill Dei Guan's escorts and subdue Jade Dragon after Rat renders him powerless with her claws laced with an inhibitor drug. China Force hoped that Dei Guan would be found guilty as a traitor and killed so a message would be sent to several members that defected which included Horse, Monkey and the Dog. They would board a plane headed back to their ship in Anchorage when they are placed under the spell of the <a href=\"/dreamqueen/4005-44536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44536\">Dreamqueen</a> when China Force entered her sphere of influence. The Dreamqueen altered the perception of the China Force members so they believed they were back home in China and she used them as pawns to attack her most hated foes, <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a>. China Force would come into conflict with Alpha Flight when they believed they were being invaded by the Canadian heroes.

This situation stood until the events of the <a href=\"/messiah-complex/4045-48995/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\">Messiah Complex</a> storyline when <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> authorized <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> to form a new mutant team that would secretly operate and use lethal force to deal with threats to the X-Men.</p><p>The new <a href=\"/x-force/4050-20511/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20511\">X-Force</a> that Wolverine assembled included Warpath, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a>, <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>, <a href=\"/hepzibah/4005-13868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13868\">Hepzibah</a> and <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a>. After Messiah Complex, Caliban was dead and Hepzibah was left out of the line-up. The team was later joined by <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a>, Domino, <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir</a> and <a href=\"/vanisher/4005-6756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher</a>.</p><p>The conclusion of the <a href=\"/second-coming/4045-55971/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55971\">Second Coming</a> storyline brought Wolverine's X-Force team to an end as the existence of this deadly team was made known to the other mutants, even resulting in the departure of <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> from the X-Men. Little did Cyclops know that Wolverine had other ideas. Behind Cyclops' back Wolverine formed yet another secret X-Force team, with <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a>, <a href=\"/fantomex/4005-4281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4281\">Fantomex</a>, Angel and <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a> forming the initial line-up. They are later joined by an alternate reality <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> as they deal with <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a>'s heirs.</p><p>After that team disbanded, two teams emerged. Cable ran one as a clandestine group responding to Cable's new premonitions. The other was run by Psylocke under orders from Wolverine to investigate a psychic drug. The two teams would eventually butt heads when Cable's team learns Psylocke's team is protecting <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a>, last seen trying to kill Hope Summers.</p><p>The New Mutant roster would eventually reunite when a younger version of Cable became active in the present, but this was short-lived. Soon after, Pr. X and Magneto would tame <a href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\">Krakoa</a>, creating a nation-state for mutants. The X-Force moniker would be co-opted by Wolverine and Beast's counterintelligence and wetworks team to protect their new home.</p><h2>Cable's Team</h2><h3>The Militaristic Approach</h3><p>Arising from the ashes of the too-quickly disbanded New Mutants, Cable’s new team is primed to attack their enemies first so they don’t have to ask questions later. The team’s first base is in the Adirondack Mountains, a former sentinel hub. The team has plenty to do: Cable needs to track down and kill Stryfe, Shatterstar needs to exact revenge on <a href=\"/mojoverse/4020-42277/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42277\">Mojoworld</a>, Warpath needs to find out who whipped out his reservation, and Feral needed asylum from the Morlocks.</p><p>The first order of business is to find Stryfe in a base in Antarctica. The team works well together despite their youthfulness and gets the upper hand. Stryfe and his lackeys escape to fight another day. X-Force returns home and is oblivious to the fact that they have more enemies on the way: S.H.I.E.L.D. An old ally-turned-enemy of Cable’s, <a href=\"/gw-bridge/4005-15062/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15062\">G.W. Bridge</a>, wants the renegade group and begins to form a team to capture them.</p><h3>Sabotage</h3><p>Though they fought well in Antarctica, Cable recognizes the need to enhance team unity. He schedules an outside exercise in which the team hunts Feral. The game turns deadly, however, when her unchecked instincts get Cannonball gutted. He is cared for and she is reprimanded (though nowhere near has harsh a reprimand as she deserves). Cannonball heals in record time, which is perfect since the team is called in to help with a very delicate situation; Black Tom Cassidy and the <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a> has taken hostages in one of the World Trade Center towers.</p><p>Arriving on the scene, X-Force encounters Siryn taking on the Juggernaut by herself. Cable invites her to the team and splits into two task forces. Cable leads a team inside the building to confront Black Tom and hopefully free the executives (of which they find their old friend Sunspot). The other group is to be the muscle taking out the Juggernaut. Boom Boom, however, is left to man their aircraft. X-Force’s tactics are very harsh and Black Tom has to resort to his back-up plan almost immediately – he blows up the building. This means little to Cable. He still seeks out Black Tom and shoots to kill. Deadpool, who teleports in and snags Black Tom before he can fall to his death, saves the villain from certain death, however. He also snags the Juggernaut. X-Force flees the scene when a S.H.I.E.L.D. vehicle shows up.</p><h3>Ambushed at Home</h3><h4>The New Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</h4><p>The fallout from the World Trade Center fiasco paints X-Force in a very negative light. Boy Scout Cannonball hates the idea of being viewed as a renegade but Cable thinks it advantageous in light of how their enemies will view the team now. With a target on their backs, the team begins training rigorously. Without warning, X-Force is attacked by the newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and their allies the Morlocks. X-Force is split with some team members above ground and others inside the mountain base. The battle is fierce with neither side really gaining any ground until <a href=\"/sauron/4005-3180/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3180\">Sauron</a> stabs Cannonball through the gut, supposedly killing him instantly. Cable races Cannonball’s body to the infirmary while the rest of the team fights. Cable returns and ends the fight and admits that Cannonball has died. Cannonball then wakes up and learns that he is supposed to belong to a select group of immortal mutants called the Externals.</p><p>Cannonball recovers quickly (supposedly because of his immortal make-up). X-Force begins training again and gets transported to another dimension when a wormhole opens up in their base. The world they visit is filled with magic and jumbo cats. They briefly butt heads with the <a href=\"/warheads/4060-47411/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47411\">Warheads</a> before making their way back home through a fresh wormhole. The brush-in with the Warheads prompts Cable to personally investigate their employer, <a href=\"/mys-tech/4060-50992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50992\">MyS-Tech</a>.</p><h4>Weapon: PRIME</h4><p>X-Force picks up the pieces from its latest battle by casting the bodies of <a href=\"/masque/4005-7252/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7252\">Masque</a> and <a href=\"/thornn/4005-3192/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3192\">Thornn</a> at the Morlocks' feet. In their base, however, Deadpool breaks in and delivers a message to Domino that she better get her act back together. When Cable and the others return Domino comes clean about her involvement with Tolliver. Before the team can plan an attack on Tolliver, G.W. Bridge's team <a href=\"/weapon-prime/4060-41032/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41032\">Weapon: PRIME</a> attacks the X-Force base. Cable and Domino get separated while Cannonball leads the rest of X-Force into victory over Weapon:PRIME and a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> backup unit. The base is blown up and X-Force steals one of the government issued aircrafts from SHIELD to go in search of a new base. Rictor, a former friend and current Weapon:PRIME member, rejoins the team.</p><p>En route to a new base, <a href=\"/crule/4005-15529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15529\">Crule</a> attacks the team. He is subdued and cast out of the aircraft, but not before he tells them about Sunspot's position of being experimented on by <a href=\"/gideon/4005-2162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2162\">Gideon</a>. Cannonball leads the team on an assault of the lab in New Mexico and they save Sunspot. They then find a home on Warpath's destroyed reservation at <a href=\"/camp-verde/4020-57574/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57574\">Camp Verde</a>.</p><h3>X-Cutioner's Song</h3><p>Before X-Force can get to comfortable with their new home they see a man resembling Cable shoot Professor Xavier at a concert during the events of the <a href=\"/x-cutioners-song/4045-42178/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42178\">X-Cutioner's Song</a>. They go to investigate the scene but get attacked by members of X-Factor and the X-Men. X-Force puts up a good fight but ultimately get subdued and arrested. They are held at Xavier's mansion on the suspicion that they are confederates of Cable's. The team is slowly let out and they join the search for the real shooter of Xavier. Their search takes them to the Moon where they learn that Stryfe looks exactly like Cable and must have been the one to shoot Xavier. They can't help but watch as Cable battles Stryfe until the two men are sucked into a time portal.</p><p>Xavier soon heals and X-Force can't help but wonder when they are allowed to leave. Charges still exist against them but they rebel and leave before given clearance. Siryn and Warpath copy the X-Men's files to beef up the X-Force intel. <a href=\"/lila-cheney/4005-4556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4556\">Lila Cheney</a> also joins the team.</p><h3>Graymalkin</h3><p>When a Stark Industries satellite uncovers the location of Cable's old space base, X-Force quickly teleports up to salvage whatever then can from their fallen leader. SHIELD and War Machine also want a piece of the pie but get soundly defeated by the young team. Cannonball and Sunspot are able to jettison off most of the weapons and vehicles to their base back on Earth. X-Force narrowly escapes as Cable's sentient computer seemingly destroys the base.</p><h3>Freeing Friends</h3><p>Upon getting home, X-Force discovers that Warpath, Siryn, and Boomer have been taken captive by the Externals. The team abducts Crule from a hospital and questions him as to the Externals' whereabouts and then discard him in the ocean, bodycast and all. X-Force finds the External base and reclaims their friends.</p><p>Without any time to rest, X-Force learns of old pals <a href=\"/rusty-collins/4005-13376/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13376\">Rusty</a> and <a href=\"/skids/4005-3194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3194\">Skids</a> becoming captives of the <a href=\"/friends-of-humanity/4060-40563/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40563\">Friends of Humanity</a>. They effectively take down the opposition and rescue their friends, though they learn that the two are under mind-controlling technology courtesy of their former master Stryfe.</p><h3>Cable Returns</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/fatal-attractions/4045-41878/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41878\">Fatal Attractions</a> story arc, X-Force arrives home from saving Rusty and Skids and gets the sense that someone has been, or still, in their base. They split up and each team gets taken out but Cable. The reunion is short-lived, however, when Camp Verde is visited by <a href=\"/exodus/4005-4567/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4567\">Exodus</a>. He invites Cannonball and Sunspot to a mutant heaven. They accept and Cannonball slips Cable a tracking device. X-Force soon follows the signal to Cable's former base of Graymalkin, now transformed into a refuge run by <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> called Avalon. Cannonball and Sunspot return to Earth with X-Force while Cable extracts the Professor from his former home. Magneto and Cable clash and Magneto shreds Cable's metal parts. Cable barely manages to bodyslide back to the X-Force base and he spends a while recuperating while being hooked up to various machines intent on fixing his parts. He takes time to evaluate the team and realizes that he needs a more personal focus in dealing with his recruits.</p><h3>The New Mutant Liberation Front</h3><p>When Henry Peter Gyrich, a staunch anti-mutant politician is abducted by a new MLF, Cable puts X-Force into play. They go to Bermuda to an old Magneto base and find the MLF being led by a new villain named <a href=\"/reignfire/4005-15520/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15520\">Reignfire</a>. They do their best to subdue the terrorist outfit, but Reignfire gets the last laugh when he gets Feral to defect and join the MLF. X-Force also is shocked to learn that one of their past friends <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Dani Moonstar</a> could be aligned with this new iteration of the MLF. As a result, and even though they save the politician, Cable knows the mission wasn't worth the effort.</p><h2>Wolverine's Wetworks Team</h2><p>In the middle of the <a href=\"/messiah-complex/4045-48995/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\">Messiah CompleX</a> storyline, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> assembled a new X-Force, which consist of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>'s best trackers. The new team is made out of Wolverine as team leader, X-23, Warpath, Wolfsbane, <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a> and <a href=\"/hepzibah/4005-13868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13868\">Hepzibah</a>. Their first mission was to track <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> and the newly discovered <a href=\"/baby-mutant/4005-49329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\">Baby Mutant</a>, before the <a href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\">Purifiers</a>, <a href=\"/marauders/4060-40480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\">Marauders</a> <a href=\"/reavers/4060-9726/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\">Reavers</a> and <a href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\">Predator X</a> could get them first. They also participated in the final battle against the Marauders on <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\">Muir Island</a>. However, after the death of Caliban and injury of Hepzibah, it was believed that X-Force was disbanded.</p><h3>Angels and Demons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/679390-xforce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-679390\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/679390-xforce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-679390\"><img alt=\"The new X-Force\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11233/679390-xforce1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11233/679390-xforce1.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></a><figcaption>The new X-Force</figcaption></figure><p>In the aftermath of Messiah Complex, Cyclops reassembled X-Force once again. Wolverine did not want X-23 or Warpath involved, but they refuse to leave when given the opportunity. Wolverine did not press the issue, believing that they had the right to choose their own destiny. Their first mission, after the events of the Messiah Complex, was to infiltrate a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> facility, where a group of Purifiers have stolen valuable technology needed to resurrect a <a href=\"/sentinel/4005-8299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8299\">Sentinel</a> named <a href=\"/bastion/4005-40568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40568\">Bastion</a>. Complications arose when that same group captured Wolfsbane, prior to their arrival, and threatened to shoot her. X-23 thought it was a bluff and attacked anyway, by detonating explosive charges that she had placed and armed off panel. Wolfsbane was seemingly shot by <a href=\"/matthew-risman/4005-47984/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47984\">Matthew Risman</a>, head of The Purifiers, in the face. It was later revealed that Risman actually shot Wolfsbane in the knee. Risman then took Wolfsbane to Purifier headquarters while the rest of X-force return to Angel's mansion, where Wolverine yelled at X-23 for disobeying his orders. X-23 stated that her mission was never to protect her teammates but to kill Matthew Risman, and Cyclops backed her up. When they were able to save Wolfsbane, they returned to Angel's mansion and summoned Elixir to heal her. When she woke up, she attacked Elixir, X-23 and Angel. During this attack, she had ripped off Angel's wings and took them to the Purifiers, to be used to build an army of angels that will serve to eradicate the remaining mutants. Angel awoke as Archangel ready to kill X-Force but X-23 was prepared to fight off his attacks. Unlike with Wolfsbane, Wolverine had said nothing about dying for Angel. In the middle of the fight, Archangel flew to the location of the Purifiers with the X-Force following him. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Purifiers were having a standoff on who is the rightful leader. Before the argument escalated, Archangel went on a killing spree; targeting the choir and demanding his wings back, while the X-Force went on the attack as well. In another part of the facility, <a href=\"/reverend-craig/4005-14853/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14853\">Reverend Craig</a> was hunting down Wolfsbane, saying that she is condemned to be a demon. He was then later attacked by Wolfsbane, presumably killing him. The X-Force managed to defeat the Purifiers but not completely, as Bastion and his resurrected puppets of prominent, former, X-Men enemies were able to escape. As at the end, it is shown that Archangel presumably returned back to normal. Back at <a href=\"/angels-aerie/4020-55689/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55689\">Angel's Aerie</a>, they report back to Cyclops on what happened and now decides on who is next in their hit list.</p><h3>Old Ghosts</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440305\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5177065767285\" data-width=\"593\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 593px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440305\"><img alt=\"X-Force #7\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg 593w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Force #7\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg 593w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Force #7</figcaption></figure><p>Back at home, the X-Force investigates what could have triggered the transformation of Angel and the triggered rage of Wolfsbane. They also thought about what to do with Elixir, since he now knows too much about the X-Force. They thought about killing him, but X-23 called the <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\">Stepford Cuckoos</a> to erase Elixir's memories about the X-Force. But before they could do this, the team saw <a href=\"/graydon-creed/4005-13351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\">Graydon Creed</a> on TV, saying that the assassination on him was just a cover-up to protect himself. They want to go after him, but Cyclops stop them because that have to go after Vanisher first because he has taken hold of a strain of the <a href=\"/legacy-virus/4015-42281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\">Legacy Virus</a>. They all go except for Warpath, who goes home to visit the grave of his brother but was suddenly attacked by the <a href=\"/demon-bear/4005-15552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15552\">Demon Bear</a>. He was almost killed if it weren't for the intervention of <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4005-4268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4268\">Ghost Rider</a>, who help Warpath escape the creature.</p><p>X-Force tracks down Vanisher in <a href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\">Japan</a> but they also run in with Domino, who tagged along to find the <a href=\"/legacy-virus/4015-42281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\">Legacy Virus</a>. When they manage to find Vanisher, they interrogated him through Elixir's powers inducing a brain tumor, which prompted Vanisher to tell them that he had lost the Legacy Virus to a fight with the clones of the <a href=\"/marauders/4060-40480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\">Marauders</a> that was awakened when <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mister Sinister</a> died. When the X-Force got to the place where Vanisher lost the Legacy Virus, Domino manage to find it, but as they were about to leave with it, but are quickly attacked by <a href=\"/the-right/4060-56070/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56070\">The Right</a> who is there to take it into their possession. X-Force fight back, X-23 fighting the Right members with the virus. But as they fight, X-23 drops the virus and is stabbed at the same time, the virus being released into her body. She decides after killing the Right member by popping her claws into his head, to kill herself by jumping into a vat of furnace to destroy the virus along with her. The other members of X-Force cover Elixir as he chases after X-23 hoping to save her. He catches up with her, but she still jumps off. Luckily, Elixir catches her hand, and purges the virus out of her. This however took too much out of him and he drops her. Later, she's revealed to be alive, Josh managing to divert her course slightly, and she caught on fire, burning her hair away and her skin. She took Josh's shirt and left him bare chested.</p><p>Back with Warpath and <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4005-4268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4268\">Ghost Rider</a>, and Ghost Rider tells him the story of the ancient magic invoked by the elders of the Apache, and how he can channel their shamanistic powers to help him fight the Demon Bear which they call it \"The Ghost Dance\". The two quickly attack the Bear, slashing at it. Suddenly, Ghost Rider notices the Demon Bear had a knife stuck in its hide. He alerts Warpath, who removes it. The Demon Bear then releases totemic spirits, Ghost Rider revealing them to be the Apache gods, corrupted by the knife. The Gods then showed Warpath who they're true enemy was. Back with Wolfsbane, and she's in the forest, searching for someone in the forest. Suddenly, the creature makes an appearance, revealing himself to the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Asgardian God</a> of Wolves and her former lover, <a href=\"/hrimhari/4005-45354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45354\">Hrimhari</a>. All of them meet back at Angel's mansion, the X-Force team from Japan having recaptured the Vanisher and gagged him. They see Warpath on the floor, and ask him what's wrong. He tells them that his entire tribe has been dug up, including his brother Thunderbird.

Suddenly, her mutant powers within her explode, affecting everyone at the rally. Her powers made everyone forget everything, including to keep pumping their own hearts. The <a href=\"/leper-queen/4005-41482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41482\">Leper Queen</a> had injected Beautiful Dreamer with a different strain of the Legacy Virus that affected her powers, changing them and making them unstable.</p><p><a href=\"/alisande-morales/4005-55399/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55399\">Agent Morales</a> begins to put the puzzle pieces together as she assumes that X-23 is connected to a lot of the previous mysteries still unsolved by SHIELD.

He's called away by Angel, who flies him to Alcatraz where the rest of X-Force are. Cyclops arrives to find Domino laughing at a Vanisher who's screaming in pain, X-23 having cut off his ear after he'd tried to persuade Elixir to heal his tumor. Cyclops informs them of the incident with Beautiful Dreamer, and they debate, until Vanisher makes another comment and X-23 offers to torture him some more.</p><p>X-Force split up: Archangel and X-23, Vanisher and Warpath and Domino and Wolverine. Each are at a different Friends of Humanity rally, expecting them yet again to throw a mutant into the rally and kill everyone there. X-23 smells something burning, and <a href=\"/fever-pitch/4005-15322/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15322\">Fever Pitch</a> stumbles into the crowd, screaming for help.

After X-Force escapes the explosion, they are discussing what exactly happened and Archangel shows further indications that he is becoming more and more unhinged. He also adds that he saw the Leper Queen there but was unable to get to her in time. This confirms that she is with Bastion.</p><p>Cyclops approves Wolverine's kill order for Leper Queen and gives them another mission: To help Cable and the mutant baby, Hope. He gives them all time travel devices that will give them 33.2 hours in the future before returning them home. The Cuckoos pinpoint were the Leper Queen is and Cyclops has them relay that information to Wolverine. Agents of <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">HAMMER</a> come to the conclusion that X-23 will be in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> because the Leper Queen is there and the <a href=\"/united-nations/4060-57235/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57235\">United Nations</a>, whom the agents think is X-23's target as well, are going to be there. HAMMER mobilizes two attack squads to intercept X-23.</p><p>Back at Angel's Aerie, Rahne Sinclair confides in Hrimhari while X-Force teleports to New York. At the same time, Leper Queen is injecting both Hellion and <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge</a> with the new Legacy Virus and sends them to cause destruction at the United Nations but keeps an uninfected <a href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\">Boom-Boom</a> for her own plans. X-Force moves against the Leper Queen and kill everyone that is still in her hideout except Leper Queen. She is holding Boom-Boom hostage in hopes that they will kill her to end her suffering. Vanisher knocks Leper Queen away from Boom-Boom and Wolverine jumps on her just as Cyclops gives the order to transport X-Force into the future. Having been denied the death she was hoping for, Leper Queen shoots Boom-Boom in the head, killing her.</p><h3>Messiah War</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-801812\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5183333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-801812\"><img alt=\"Messiah War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Messiah War\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11233/801812-xforcecable.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Messiah War</figcaption></figure><p>X-Force find themselves having traveled 900 years into the future on their next mission; to protect Cable and the supposedly mutant messiah, Hope. Elixir complained about going back to the present to save their friends that were left behind. Wolverine promised him that they will. Logan then ordered Vanisher to teleport and scout ahead, but Telford claims that his powers are somehow being blocked. Following that, Vanisher was suddenly shot in the neck, causing X-Force to take cover from the unknown sniper. It later turned out to be Deadpool, who was still very much alive as a result of his healing factor. Wade told the X-Force that Cable will be at the old Xavier Institute. Now with some heading, they set out to finish their mission.</p><p>Suddenly, X-23 picked up Cable's scent and began tracking him. When Wolverine was about to face Cable, he instead met up with Hope, with Cable pointing a gun in his temple. Wolverine informed Cable that they were sent to the future by his father (Cyclops) to help him against <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a>. Cable had news of his own, and he updated the other time travelers that Bishop was in league with Stryfe, Cable's clone.</p><p>When X-Force and Cable were attacked by Stryfe's army: Hope, Elixir and Vanisher escaped the skirmish. A division in the ranks occurred when Angel was drawn away by a voice whispering in his mind. When the battle is over, Cable warned Vanisher not to take away Hope from him. They were then attacked by Stryfe directly, who soundly defeated them one by one. Even as Cable detonated a bomb within Stryfe's armor, it was useless. Stryfe captured both Hope and Warpath. Running out of time, the X-Force split up into two teams; X-23, Domino, Vanisher and Deadpool will look for the power source that has been blocking Cable's time traveling and Vanisher's powers, while Cable, Wolverine and Elixir rescue Hope and Warpath.</p><p>When Stryfe brought them to citadel, Bishop makes his move on killing Hope, but he was stopped by Stryfe. He was then able to read his mind and know Hope's significance. Hope removed Stryfe's helmet and she ask if he is Cable. Warpath was able to destroy his restraint and attack Stryfe but he was defeated when Hope distracted him. It was then that Bishop retaliated to Stryfe but he destroyed his cybernetic arm. Stryfe was then attacked by Cable using his psionic power, which supposedly burned out. Stryfe defeated his \"brother\" but it was a planed distraction for Wolverine and Elixir attack from behind.</p><p>While Domino's team is looking for the source, Deadpool admitted that he has been hearing Stryfe in his mind and he plans to kill the X-Force. When they found the source, Laura was surprise that the source of the block is her friend, <a href=\"/kiden-nixon/4005-40702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40702\">Kiden Nixon</a>, who was kidnapped by Bishop and Stryfe from the present and hooked on into a machine that strengthen her powers to block anyone who can manipulate time and space. As time runs out, the X-Force begins to experience the negative effects of their time-traveling armbands. Kiden asks Laura to kill her as it is the only way to prevent them from being killed, but she is hesitating. It wasn't until Domino shot Kiden in the head that the time-space warp had stop. Vanisher wondered why weren't they killed by their armbands but before Domino could come up with an answer, Vanisher pressed the armband and he backtrack in time to the present. Deadpool arrived and blasted Stryfe with a laser cannon but Stryfe ripped him in half. With Deadpool dead and the other team attacking Stryfe still feeling the effects of the armband on their body, Stryfe moves in for Hope, but everyone was surprise that Apocalypse barges in, being accompanied by his horseman of death, Archangel. Together, they defeated Stryfe, with Apocalypse delivering the final blow.</p><p>As this was going on, Bishop takes aim at Hope, but he was too weak to shoot. Apocalypse carried Hope into his arms and was about to kill Bishop, but he time-traveled to escape. Apocalypse took interest on Hope as his potential host, but Cable and X-Force surrounded him, with Logan asking Warren on which side he was on. Warren told Apocalypse that he had owed him his life by sparing his own, and he demanded Hope to be returned to them and Apocalypse agrees to this, but not before Apocalypse warned Cable that he will come back for the child. As X-Force left the citadel, Apocalypse is seen dragging Stryfe's weakened body to become his new host. Wolverine then ordered Cable to time-travel with Hope and X-Force splitting up again with Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir going to the UN, while X-23 prematurely cuts off Warpath and Domino's armband and goes to save Boom Boom alone.</p><h3>Not Forgotten</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-804206\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-804206\"><img alt=\"Not Forgotten\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg 669w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg 446w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Not Forgotten\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg 669w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/804206-132_x_force_18.jpg 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Not Forgotten</figcaption></figure><p>All members of X-Force came back at the same moment they left to jump forward in time. X-23 was able to kill Leper Queen before she could kill Boom-Boom. Before dying, she thanked X-23 for setting her free from Bastion's control. X-23 then collapsed from the fatigue she experience from time-travel. It that moment that agents of <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">HAMMER</a> storm in and apprehended their primary target, X-23. Boom-Boom was left with two HAMMER agent with one of them about to rape her, when she was saved by Warpath. Meanwhile in the UN, <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge</a> and <a href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\">Hellion</a> tries to escape from their captors but the Legacy Virus within them begins to flare out. Angel and Wolverine came in just in time with Elixir who was able to purge the virus in Hellion's body and barely saved Surge's life, but her powers became out of control and was about to explode. Luckily, Hellion redirected her energy to the sky before passing out. Back in their base, Beast and <a href=\"/dr-james-bradley/4005-29259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29259\">Dr. Bradley</a> evaluate Hellion and Surge medical condition as normal.</p><p>In an undisclosed location, X-23 is reunited to her old handler from the <a href=\"/the-facility/4060-48035/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48035\">Facility</a>, <a href=\"/kimura/4005-41489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41489\">Kimura</a>, who begins to torture her by dismembering her arm. In a corridor, <a href=\"/agent-young/4005-57787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57787\">Agent Young</a> told Agent Morales that he was a Facility member that infiltrated <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> and he also discussed to her about joining the facility. Stating she knew that if her answer were to be no, death would be the final penalty. So without hesitation, Agent Morales took out Young and escapes to rescue X-23. Kimura was about to chop off Laura's second arm, but a bullet was shot in her head, knocking her off and the shot came from Agent Morales' gun. Upon getting X-23 out of the chains, Morales couldn't understand why this child was still standing. Before questions could be answered, Kimura threatened to kill Morales. X-23 told Morales to run and both women fled the scene with Kimura not that far behind. X-23 manage to pin down Kimura into a steel door and she and Morales got locked up into a laboratory where the Facility creates large amounts of trigger scent that forces X-23 to go into a berserker rage.</p><p>X-23 tells Morales to take shelter after giving her <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium</a> claws and triggering an explosion in the laboratory. Outside the laboratory, facility guards are opening the door when the sprinkler system activates and the trigger scent begins to shower the whole facility. When the doors are opened, X-23 lunges towards the facility guards and begins to kill everyone in a murderous frenzy. <a href=\"/adam-harkin/4005-65447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65447\">Prof Harkin</a> is locked inside of office, calling for Kimura's help. X-23 barges in and was about to kill him but she was knock out by Kimura. She then kills the professor and was about to kill X-23 but Agent Morales threw a Molotov cocktail to her, setting her on fire. Morales then help X-23 to her feet and escapes, but not before placing other Molotov cocktail in all of the flammable and explosive parts of the Facility. Agent Morales and X-23 escapes the destroyed Facility, after which Kimura warned X-23 that she will kill everyone that she loved. It was then that the Stepford Cuckoos found X-23 where Domino and Wolverine pick her up with <a href=\"/illyana-rasputin/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik</a> teleporting them out.</p><h3>Utopia</h3><p>X-Force was deployed as a rescue team to save other mutants that will be subjected to <a href=\"/dark-beast/4005-3422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3422\">Dark Beast</a>'s experiments.

Luckily for X-Force, that delay gives the team the opportunity to attack. Betsy looks in the minds of the Horsemen, finding out their names, histories and powers. She tells Wolverine that Death's power comes from metal, using his rings to inflict disease on the team. Wolverine then takes on Death, leaving Fantomex and Psylocke to take on the others. Betsy turns off Fantomex's ears, so he can be safe from Famine's bio-sonic consumption. She also disconnects his peripheral and nociceptor nerves in order to turn off his pain. War then knocks out Betsy with a punch to the head and Pestilence takes on Fantomex, he uses his powers of misdirection to make her believe he is her father, then swiftly knocks her out, breaking her jaw in the process. He then begins to use his powers of misdirection to swap Wolverine with Pestilence, infecting her with many diseases, while Fantomex gets the near dead Wolverine away from the fight. Elsewhere Deadpool tries to help Archangel, who was severely affected by Famine's powers. Meanwhile War, who had taken Psylocke and returned with her to his room. There she heals and when she wakes, War tells her he is in love with her. After Fantomex's misdirection wears off, the rest of the Horsemen retreat to their base and prepare to lift-off. Psylocke, who made it inside, flirts with War, and gets close enough to him to drive her psychic knife into his skull, incapacitating him. The ship is about to take off, and Wolverine, Fantomex, Deadpool and Archangel are left behind.

The Reavers are blackmailing Gateway to open a portal to Utopia, otherwise they'll kill his family/tribe. X-Force then confronts the Reavers in Australia. Lady Deathstrike plans on making Wolverine suffer; she doesn't want him to die. While Logan and Deathstrike fight, one of the Reavers blows up in front of Fantomex and Deadpool. Psylocke and Archangel are left against the rest of them. Some of the Reavers are seen using Gateway's portal to Utopia, and Psylocke goes after them alone. Pixie is on security duty and spots intruders on the radar on Utopia. Cyclops and Magneto find out they're Reavers, but by the time they find them they're all dead. Psylocke had used her telepathy and stealth to get to the Reavers before the X-Men do and killed them. She leaves their corpses and leaves Utopia unnoticed. Back in the Outback, Wolverine beats Deathstrike and she uploads herself through a computer and escapes.

Deadpool leaves and Logan tells Warren to remove Wade from the team. Warren tells Logan that Deadpool has worked for him for a year and he hasn't cashed any of the checks he paid him. Hinting that Wade just might be there because he wants to be. Fantomex visits his mother at home. She tells him he has a good conscience and that she feels she had a part in making sure he grew up with good ethic in the small amount of time she had to raise him. The two are ambushed by heroes fused with deathlok tech.

The alternate Deathlok units are comprised of superheroes who in the future are hunted, killed, and then reanimated as super-cop Deathlok units, which the government sanctions. The alternate Deathloks have been sent back in time to protect their possible future by obtaining a weapon known as the World. Apparently, after Fantomex killed the child Apocalypse, it caused a disturbance in the time stream sending Deathloks and their controller into phone-booth time machines to fix the glitch. Meanwhile, Psylocke tells <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\">Brian Braddock</a> that she aided in the murder of a child. Brian gets angry, but tells her that he can't absolve or condone her, and that he will always love her. His image then disappears, and Warren asks Betsy what she was doing alone in the Danger Room, to which she replies that she was talking to herself. Fantomex and Deathlok manage to escape the other Deathloks with the aid of X-Force. Fantomex then decides that the only way to stop this is by killing the \"Father\".

X-Force then decide to split up. Fantomex and Deadpool end up arguing with each other over their behavior and attitude. Meanwhile, Logan and Deathlok happen to face Deathlok-Wolverine. Elsewhere, Psylocke argues with Angel. He seems to think of her \"mothering\" him too much, whereas Betsy is concerned because he hasn't come to her for their psychic exercises. Both are chased by Deathlocks versions of Psylocke/Warren. They fly at high speeds and Psylocke turns around throwing her katana which stabs Deathlok-Psylocke in the head and kills her. Psylocke then tells Warren to go back for her sword. He tells her she has more of those, however she insists that she wants that one. Meanwhile, Deadpool finds the Father who uses his powers on Wade to make him love him like a father, whilst watching Fantomex being beaten by the Deathloks, trying to desperately protect what's hidden in his laboratory. Deadpool breaks free of the control and kills the Father by chopping off his head, making the Deathloks cease to exist. The team re-gather, with Wade triumphantly presenting Father's head and Fantomex tells them their mission is over. However, it is revealed that in the laboratory Fantomex brought baby Apocalypse to the World and has him incubating in a tube back in the Weapon X program.

X-Force then decides to head to the military base because they have lost contact with Deadpool. Psylocke tells the others there is a powerful telepath working in that base, and asks them to guard her while she's out to find who is it: she then sees <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">The Shadow King</a> on the astral plane. The Shadow King finds a crack in Betsy's psy shields and starts filling her head with images of her brothers telling her how shocked they are that she's a killer and that their father would be disappointed. Shadow Kings manages to break Psylocke down, but ultimately she escapes. While all of that was happening in the Astral Plane, the Shadow King had taken control over Angel, Wolverine and Deadpool. Fantomex was left alone to protect Betsy's body by misdirecting them. The mind-controlled Archangel tries to launch the missiles at Utopia. Psylocke tries to stop him, but she gets locked out of the missiles launch room, where only Warren and one other mind-controlled employee were. The Shadow King finds the Archangel persona trapped inside Warren's mind, and ends up freeing him. Archangel takes full control of Warren, and cuts Shadow King's in half, to Betsy's surprise.

They found themselves 30 years in the future with a version of Deathlok. Deathlok explained that Genesis became the new Apocalypse but was killed by X-Force. Based on that success, X-Force continued hunting criminals becoming more and more fascist. To stop this future, Psylocke attempted suicide only to be saved by AOA Nightcrawler. With their new found knowledge, the team returned to the present to set things right.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in the present, Deathlok helped them track Ultimaton to find Evan and the new Brotherhood. While the team argued what to do about Evan, Deadpool snuck away to save him from being killed by anyone, however, without his healing factor, he was outmatched by the Brotherhood. The team split up to now rescue both Evan and Wade, but they are betrayed by AOA Nightcrawler when he was manipulated by Mystique.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mystique offers up AOA Blob on a platter for AOA Nightcrawler.

A new clone of Cable was able to free his team but Volga got away.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Soon after, Fantomex’s obsessive need to be superior causes him to snap and turn against his team, upgrading himself with Volga’s biotech. The team narrowly escaped with the help of Domino. To stop Fantomex, Hope needed to mimic Volga’s biotech from her coma, which would help her find a cure for Cable, Fantomex, and herself. She distilled all her team’s rage and insecurities and uploaded them into Fantomex. This forced Fantomex to purge himself using EVA.

Wolverine was forced to use <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> to jump back into earlier versions of his body and stop Red. After killing him, Sage suggested to the <a href=\"/the-quiet-council-of-krakoa/4060-64169/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-64169\">Quiet Council</a> that they resurrect Red so that they could convince him to be an X-Force asset. Red reluctantly agreed.</p><p>When Wolverine was using Cerebro, Xavier needed to network his back-up Cerebro’s together to increase the power. As Logan traveled through time, Sage hypothesizes that Cerebro became a nexus for the collective consciousness. This caused one of the back-ups to gain sentience and start feeding on mutant brains, misunderstanding its directive to store and digest information. Quire eventually charged into action causing Cerebrax (as it was now calling itself) to explode. Quire was killed in the explosion, and his memory backups were scrubbed from the Cerebro files, making resurrection impossible.</p><p>Cerebro tech was also stolen by the American CIA, and Deadpool, who had been obsessed with proving himself worthy of Krakoa citizenship, took a gig to retrieve it. This forced him to cross paths and eventually team up with Wolverine, when they realized that they were competing with former X-Men ally, <a href=\"/danger/4005-40862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40862\">Danger</a>. She wanted the Cerebro tech to create a child to replace the X-Men, who abandoned her for their new country. Empathetic, Logan and Wade left her to her new family, and Wolverine invited Wade to join X-Force.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826442\" data-ratio=\"0.57997399219766\" data-width=\"769\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 769px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826442\"><img alt=\"Deadpool and X-Force\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg 769w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadpool and X-Force\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg 769w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826442-eadpool%20and%20x-force.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadpool and X-Force</figcaption></figure><ul><li>X-Force makes its film debut in <a href=\"/deadpool-2/4025-2315/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-2315\"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a>.

They're in fact older than the Earth, and became the embodiments of death on Earth when it was first commencing to come alive. They come from a time long before good or evil, for that matter, right or wrong. They're hellstorms, nothing more or less--living breathing tornadoes of mystical energy consuming everything in their path without restraint or remorse. They were trapped a thousand years ago in their own dimension by the <span class=\"yui-non\">Northern Gods</span> but the magics holding them weakened. The Great Beasts live in a realm that was once not unlike Earth, though in a universe outside our own. After a million years passed, the Beasts rose to power there. They pillaged and corrupted their world, then set forth for greener pastures. Three times they attacked Earth, the planet nearest on the mystic continuum, and three times they were driven back. The last time, they were sealed behind a barrier designed to keep them forever in the <span class=\"yui-non\">Realm of the Beasts</span>. The battle cost the victors as much as the vanquished. The land-beast <span class=\"yui-non\">Tundra</span>, who was ever at war with the beast of the snow, <span class=\"yui-non\">Kolomaq</span>, created a magical vortex that spun the energies of the barrier back onto their creators.

The efforts of his best friend and former lover <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a> persuade him to take on both her charge <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane)</a> and <a href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\">Xi’an Coy Mahn (Karma)</a>, a Vietnamese mutant referred to him by Reed Richards.

Xavier sets off to meet her immediately, bringing his two current students with him. When the trio arrive, they find that Black Eagle has been murdered at the hands of <a href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\">Donald Pierce</a>, a long-standing villain of the X-Men and former member of the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>’s Inner Circle. Dani agrees to go with Xavier, intending to track down Pierce and make him pay for what he has done.</p><p>They soon find yet another youthful mutant attacked by Pierce: <a href=\"/sunspot/4005-4644/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4644\">Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)</a>. Pierce's mercenary squad kidnaps his girlfriend and lures him into a trap. Psyche and Karma arrive in time to help him, but his girlfriend dies when she takes a bullet for Sunspot. He then joins the team of young mutants led by <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> to enact revenge on Pierce.</p><p>They are able to track down Pierce's headquarters, and decide to attack it directly as a group. Once they arrive, they encounter Pierce's mercenary squad and manage to defeat them. Amongst the squad is <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Samuel Guthrie (Cannonball)</a>, a mutant hired by Pierce to attack Xavier and his charges. Pierce commands Sam to kill Xavier, but he refuses. Xavier battles Pierce and defeats him with the use of his mental powers.</p><p>Xavier invites Sam to attend the school as well, and a couple weeks later he shows up at Xavier's school to accept.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The success of the X-Men in the 1980s convinced Marvel Comics to publish the first spinoff to be inspired by the X-Men. Popular X-Men writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a> and successful artist <a href=\"/bob-mcleod/4040-4322/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4322\">Bob McLeod</a> created the New Mutants as well as the original five students that comprised the team. Claremont and McLeod were the creative team for the first appearance of the New Mutants Graphic Novel #1 in 1982. Claremont, McLeod, and inker <a href=\"/mike-gustovich/4040-20017/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-20017\">Mike Gustovich</a> were the creative team for the first issue of the ongoing New Mutants series in 1983.</p><h2><b>Team Evolution</b></h2><p>The five young mutants stay with Xavier and become students at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters</a>. Though he does not want to teach anymore out of fear of losing more students, he quickly changes his mind. Unknown to all however, <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> only allows the new team to form at the behest of the alien <a href=\"/brood/4060-4987/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4987\">Brood</a>. Professor X was present at the battle in which the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> apparently died, but no one ever questions how or why he survived the experience. In truth, the Brood had laid an egg inside Professor X. Once inside, the egg eventually takes over the body of its victim, slowly transforming him into one of the Brood. Now almost fully under the control of the Brood, Professor X willingly allows the students to stay so that they can also become hosts to Brood eggs. But the X-Men survive the Brood attack and make a timely arrival and save their mentor and the students who would later become the New Mutants.</p><p>Like the X-Men, the New Mutants have largely different backgrounds, social statuses and ethnicity.

Once Magma was saved she would leave her home and move to the Xavier Institute and become a full-time member of the New Mutants.</p><h3>The Hellions</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977097\" data-ratio=\"0.55200655200655\" data-width=\"1221\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1221px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977097\"><img alt=\"The Hellions\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 1221w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Hellions\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 1221w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/74068/2977097-1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hellions</figcaption></figure><p>Amidst the training, gelling and strengthening of their team another team was being created by the sinister organization known as the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>. This would be created specifically to do battle with the New Mutants. They were called the <a href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\">Hellions</a>. As the New Mutants were to be X-Men in training, the Hellions were to be future members of the Hellfire Club. While some, Wolfsbane and Catseye (New Mutants and Hellions respectfully), would kind kindred spirits in each other. A larger majority would find rivals, life long enemies and in some cases future lovers. The Hellions would do battle with the New Mutants numerous times in there time as teams.</p><h3>More Members Come &amp; Go</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-142390\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.245\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142390\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/142390-141059-warlock.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Shortly after Magma joins the team, the New Mutants would have yet another recruit found in the younger sister of X-Men member Colossus by the name of Illyana Rasputin ( <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik</a>). With her mutant teleporting powers and the fact that she is the ruler and Sorceress Supreme of the dark dimension known as Limbo, she would lead the New Mutants into many new, different and darker missions. Many the likes of which the New Mutants had never seen and likely wish they never would have seen. Rounding off the team were the additions of the mutant mental linguist Douglas Ramsey (<a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Cypher</a>) and the Techno-Organic alien <a href=\"/warlock/4005-7223/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\">Warlock</a>. After this time, the X-men returned home and the New Mutants could relax a bit more and take a break after so many months of intense battles. During this more relaxing time the New Mutants met with the son of Charles Xavier, David Haller, or <a href=\"/legion/4005-13349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13349\">Legion</a>. A powerful mutant , but also a schizophrenic with witch the New Mutants had their hands full. Not soon after Professor Xavier had to leave the earth, he was injured badly and was taken into outer space for healing by his soul-mate Lilandra. Not wishing to leave the New Mutants without anyone to care for them, Xavier would turn to his long time friend and sometimes enemy Magneto to fill in for him.</p><p>Thus, it came to pass that Magneto became Headmaster of the Xavier Institute and caretaker of the New Mutants. This decision didn’t sit well with anyone. Due to this past misdeeds and violent history with the X-Men the New Mutants as a whole initially didn't trust him. Slowly he did prove himself to some of the kids but it was clear the New Mutants wouldn't do Magneto's bidding without thinking it over for at least a second time. Not soon after this the New Mutants encountered the Beyonder, a being powerful enough to lay waste to the whole universe. The mutants tried stopping him, but this resulted into the seeming deaths of all the team-members. However, the Beyonder soon thought it to be foolish and brought them back to live. Though alive, it left the New Mutants traumatized and Magneto questioning himself whether or not he was the right person to teach the young mutants. During their time with Magneto the team would see their long time teammate Magma leave their team and join their rivals the Hellions.</p><h3>Fall of the Mutants</h3><p>At a certain point the New Mutants would encounter an Ani-Mate mutant known by the name of <a href=\"/bird-brain/4005-30056/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30056\">Bird Brain</a>. <a href=\"/ani-mates/4060-57199/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57199\">Ani-Mates</a> where genetically engineered animals giving human abilities by their creator the <a href=\"/ani-mator/4005-30075/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30075\">Ani-Mator</a>. The New Mutants befriended Bird-Brain and even have him join the team for a short while. While assisting their new member on his home-island (witch was actually a prison for all the mutated animals) the New Mutants got into a heated battle with the Ani-Mator which ended with the death of one of the New Mutants. During the battle Ani-Mator was going to shoot Wolfsbane but Cypher jumped in front of her, trying to rescue her but getting hit by the bullets himself as a result.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977146-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.49.08%20am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977146\" data-ratio=\"1.2336956521739\" data-width=\"184\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 184px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977146-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.49.08%20am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977146\"><img alt=\"Cypher\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" data-width=\"184\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977146-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.49.08%20am.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977146-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.49.08%20am.png 184w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cypher\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977146-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.49.08%20am.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977146-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.49.08%20am.png 184w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" data-width=\"184\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cypher</figcaption></figure><p>Doug died a few minutes later. Filled with rage over the death of Cypher, Magik teleported the Ani-mator and his soldiers to Limbo. Letting her demons do to them whatever they wanted. After the battle Bird Brain made clear he wanted to stay with his other mutate friends on their home-island, witch was no longer a prison to them. So the team lost another member of themselves at the same day. Reeling from the death of their friend and teammate and lose of Magma and Bird-Brain, the New Mutants would follow up by denouncing Magneto’s position and his control over them. This was mainly because the New Mutants had found out that Magneto was not only working on the side of Xavier now, but he was also a member of the Hellfire Club’s Inner Circle as their White King. An organization bend on world-domination through political and financial means, as well as one of the X-Men's most feared enemy's. Although Magneto only did this to help the New Mutants, having more power</p><p>meant to protect the mutants, the New Mutant's didn't (want to) understand his point of view. The revealing of this information would only create more animosity on the side of the New Mutants against their new Headmaster. The New Mutants would later be joined by the beautiful alien known by the name of <a href=\"/gosamyr/4005-29330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29330\">Gosamyr</a>. As quickly as she joined the team, she would depart.

The Inferno was a demon invasion over New York City, the result of a trick played by Magik's second in Limbo; <a href=\"/sym/4005-10291/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10291\">S'ym</a>. Magik was the only person with enough power to close the demon gate from Limbo to Earth that made the invasion possible. But she could only achieve this by letting her darker side take full control over her. After the gate was closed the seemingly lifeless form of the Dark Child (as she was known by then) lay before her brothers feed. But nothing was further from the truth. Illyana was found inside the hull of the Dark Child. She was reduced to her child-hood and was 7 years old again. The same age she had when she was first kidnapped into Limbo all those many years ago. This was probably the result of a time-travel warp the New Mutants took during the Inferno in which the New Mutants saved the 7 year old Illyana right after she was taken to Limbo for the first time. Back to her child-state, Illyana was too young to have her mutant powers yet and lost every memory (or the ability to speak English) she had since she joined the New Mutants.</p><p>After Inferno the New Mutants and Illyana returned to the Xavier Institute, but where horrified when they saw it laying in ruins (The mansion was destroyed by Mr. Sinister during the Inferno crossover). In the ruins of their mansion they met their headmaster Magneto, alongside his new companions of the Hellfire Club. While Magneto tried to calm the kids down, they where furious with him for his absence during the Inferno and his collaborating with enemies of the X-men. They even attempted to battle him at the ruins of the school but fail short of their goal as they would be overpowered by his magnetic might. Beaten, the New Mutants went their own way, clearly letting Magneto know that they didn't want anything to do with him anymore. After this the New Mutants went to Russia to bring Illyana back to her parents, since it was too dangerous for a 7 year old child to stay with them. There they said goodbye to a good friend.</p><h3>Enter the X-Terminators</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/687909-skids13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687909\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6925\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/687909-skids13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687909\"><img alt=\"X-Terminators\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29818/687909-skids13.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29818/687909-skids13.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Terminators\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29818/687909-skids13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29818/687909-skids13.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Terminators</figcaption></figure><p>Amidst the constant fighting that that the New Mutants were involved in during the Inferno, luck would soon fall upon them.

Mirage's powers became greater and greater, and during an adventure in Asgard, she chose to stay there, serving as a Valkyrie for the Norse Gods (including Thor). But the arrival of the future warrior known as Cable would change the New Mutants the most. Aimless without a leader the New Mutants would encounter Cable and quickly take him on as a mentor. As a warrior who had seen the dark future ahead, Cable told the New Mutants the only way to stop that future from happening was to transform their team into a 'strike-force' and take the initiative themselves. During the transformation of the team another casualty arose. Long time team-member Warlock seemingly died during the events of the <a href=\"/x-tinction-agenda/4045-42177/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42177\">X-Tinction Agenda</a>. Wolfsbane was also harmed in a bad way; seeing Warlock die in front of her and being turned into a <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genoshian</a> slave made her stay in Genosha with teammate Rictor and X-man <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havok</a>.

She then left, and the real Domino took in her place with the team, that by then would be known as X-force.</p><h3><b>Shatterstar (Benjamin Russell)</b></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977069-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.33.41%20am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977069\" data-ratio=\"1.3761904761905\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977069-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.33.41%20am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977069\"><img alt=\"Shatterstar\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977069-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.33.41%20am.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977069-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.33.41%20am.png 210w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shatterstar\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977069-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.33.41%20am.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977069-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.33.41%20am.png 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shatterstar</figcaption></figure><p>A refugee from the world known as Mojo-World, Shatterstar left his home-dimension after hearing rumors about a legendary fighter and strategist who was on earth to prevent an apocalyptic future, namely Cable.

James was once a member of the Hellions, the great rivals of the New Mutants. After James left the Hellions, he returned to the reservoir where his friends and family lived. Coming there, the place was burned to the ground, and his family was missing. The only evidence left was a mask of a soldier of the Hellfire Club, the same organization that started the Hellions team. Filled with grief and wanting revenge on the people who hurt his family, James took on the name of Warpath and joined the New Mutants, just before it became X-force.</p><p>With the new members and a new mentor in Cable, the New Mutants would take on a radical change in philosophy and tactics. No more would they take the passive approach of Professor X. They would be more army like becoming soldiers, willing to do battle for what they believed in. As a result, the New Mutants would be no more. Under Cable's lead the team would segue from that of the New Mutants and officially change their name to the <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a>.</p><h3>New Mutants: Truth or Dare</h3><p>This would be one of the few and only reunions of the original New Mutants.

This resulted in a huge increase in the number of students who enrolled and attended the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute</a>. He had the current X-Men become teachers/staff and invited several of his former pupils and X-Men (including the ex-New Mutants) to return to the school as teachers and advisers to the hundreds of additional students.</p><p>The legacy of the New Mutants, would be reborn with some of the original members returning to become advisers for the students at Xavier's Institute including <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Moonstar</a>, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a>, <a href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\">Karma</a> and (later) <a href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\">Magma</a>. Due to massive amount of students enrolled at the academy, the squad system was put in place. This broke down the students into teams (average size was six members, but could be greater or fewer) with an adviser to tailor their teaching and training styles specific to the squad. Each squad had their own student-leader in addition to adviser and they each had their own costumes and color schemes. The teams regularly competed and trained in a variety of methods.</p><p>Just as there was a team called the New Mutants many years in the past, so too would there be one now. The New Mutants Squad consisted of <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir</a> (Josh Foley), <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\">Prodigy</a> (David Alleyne), <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge</a> (Noriko Ashida), <a href=\"/wallflower/4005-40535/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40535\">Wallflower</a> (Laurie Collins), <a href=\"/sofia-mantega/4005-40537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40537\">Wind Dancer</a> (Sofia Mantega), and <a href=\"/wither/4005-40511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40511\">Wither</a> (Kevin Ford).

Though after M-Day, many New Mutants were de-powered such as Prodigy and Wind Dancer. Then tragedy would occur when the, mutant hating, Purifiers launched a rocket at a bus full of de-powered mutants that were leaving the school under the cover of night. All that were aboard the bus were killed devastating those who looked on helpless to stop it. Still reeling, only days later, more deaths would follow seeing Wallflower and Icarus, both previously of the New Mutants squad, meet their untimely deaths as well, at the hand of the Purifiers. This hurt all at the mansion, but it especially hurt there former teammates, who knew them the most.</p><h3>The Return of the original New Mutants</h3><p>Years after the team have disbanded, the original New Mutants all found themselves back at the X-men island home of Utopia. Bonded together after the events of <a href=\"/x-infernus-saga/4050-33840/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33840\">X-Infernus</a> and the return of the long diseased teammate Magic, Cannonball asked Cyclops if he could make his own team within the X-men to take on different threats around the world. With Cyclops' approval, Cannonball brought together his old team members; Moonstar, Magma, Karma, Sunspot and Magic. The team's first mission was to investigate the strange disappearance of a young mutant girl. Eventually this resulted in the discovery that the mutant son of Charles Xavier, Legion, was alive and well. The mutants just barley defeated his evil persona, and brought him back to Utopia after the fight was done and the girl was rescued.</p><h3>Necrosha</h3><p>Not soon after this, the techno-organic Warlock, old team-member of the New Mutants, returned from outer space, to see his old friends again. He first went to the X-mansion, but when he saw it laying in waste (after the events of the Messiah Complex) Warlock started searching for the mutants. He found them at the island of Utopia, just before disaster would strike with <a href=\"/necrosha/4045-55941/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55941\">Necrosha</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977150-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.51.16%20am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977150\" data-ratio=\"1.2170212765957\" data-width=\"235\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 235px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977150-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.51.16%20am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977150\"><img alt=\"Cypher attacking Magma\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" data-width=\"235\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977150-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.51.16%20am.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977150-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.51.16%20am.png 235w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cypher attacking Magma\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977150-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.51.16%20am.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977150-screen%20shot%202013-04-12%20at%2012.51.16%20am.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" data-width=\"235\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cypher attacking Magma</figcaption></figure><p>A long time adversary of the X-men and the New Mutants named <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene</a> had brought back a large number of diseased mutants, including Doug Ramsey, long dead friend of the New Mutants. She used these dead mutants as slaves to fight against the X-men on their island. When Warlock first encountered Doug, he was ecstatic, but soon he was drained of all his energy by Doug, nearly killing Warlock in the process. The 'zombie' Doug sought and found the New Mutants, first almost beating Magma to death and then leading other dead mutants, including the dead advisories of the New Mutants, the Hellions into the headquarters of the X-men.</p><p>A large fight erupted. Thankfully a new X-force team managed to defeat Selene and putting all the dead mutants to their rest. Strangely, this did not happened to Doug, probably because Warlock was able to break the virus code through witch Doug was made a zombie to serve Selene. All his friends gathered around him, and Doug told them that 'they' were his language. After these events all the original New Mutants where back together again, except for Rahne. She stayed with X-force and later went back to the new X-factor agency.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1163544\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6157989228007\" data-width=\"557\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 557px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:161.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1163544\"><img alt=\"New Mutants in Second Coming\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg 557w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg 396w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New Mutants in Second Coming\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg 557w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/25733/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02.jpg 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New Mutants in Second Coming</figcaption></figure><p>During the crossover of <a href=\"/second-coming/4045-55971/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55971\">Second Coming</a>, Sam and his team are sent to fight against The Right and Cameron Hodge. During this Xi'an gets injured, resulting in her leg being amputated. Warlock also had to look past his vow of not killing another human life in order to save the New Mutants. Doug also found information on Bastion's towers. On another mission Illyana was sent to the X-Men, during this mission Illyana is sent to Limbo, but is saved in the Hellbound tie-in by a team lead by Sam, which featured no other New mutants.

The team head to a ranch while the new antagonist of the series, General Ulysses moves his forces out. Sam stresses the importance of talking about their feelings about what happened with very little response until he mentions he brought lots of beer, which prompts Dani to ask the others to hear him out. At this point, Cypher mentions that Warlock does not like watching them eat because of what happened against Hodge. Roberto and Amara further hinting to a relationship, and finally one of Sam and Dani kissing with no explanation as to how they got to that point. Illyana then feels something happening in the distance. General Ulysses soldiers then reach their destination and attack their target, which is revealed to be Pixie, whom they defeat, tie up, and then steal her soul dagger.</p><p>Soon after, Illyana transports Warlock to the X-Men to tell them what is happening as he once caused problems there. She then teleports the team to Limbo against Sam's wishes. She speaks to her minions who have captured <a href=\"/witchfire/4005-26481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26481\">Witchfire.</a> Witchfire tells them where the men who stole the bloodstone amulet went. They travel far in Limbo over a long period of time and arrive in the military base through a portal. Meanwhile Pixie tries to escape and uses her pixie dust to make the soldiers hallucinate. They plan to use her soul dagger to pull the rest of her soul out of her body. Illyana confronts the military men but is taken down by one of the <a href=\"/inferno-babies/4060-57906/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57906\">Inferno babies</a>, who then prepare to attack the rest of the New Mutants. One of the children blows off his face while fighting the demons and has it replaced with a way to focus the blasts that come from his face when he uses his powers. The kids blame the New Mutants for being handed over to the government, which causes them to realize that they are the Inferno children. The children then say that once they are done with Illyana, they will kill her. The New Mutants attack the Inferno children and are all defeated one at a time.</p><p>Shan makes contact with Face, the mutant without a face. Sam is then tied up surrounded by dynamite, while Dani is being tortured in a room close by. The mutant guarding Sam can taste emotions, and Sam's worry for Dani tastes delicious. Pixie's soul is ripped out of her body using Illyana's Soulsword and Pixie's Souldagger. Ulysses plans to use the bloodstone amulet to strike fear in the demons of Limbo. Illyana is thrown into a room with Amara and Roberto. He then asks if Amara will die, and Illyana tells him that she will and that she does not love him as Roberto loves her. Sam continues to worry about Dani, who helps him by saying he is an excellent kisser, taking away the feelings that his captor was enjoying. With the new bloodstone, Ulysses and his men move out to go back to Limbo. It is then revealed that they are planning to sacrifice the New Mutants to the Elder Gods. Shan is being prepared to be moved, but some of the Inferno children decide to amputate her bionic leg. She talks to Face again and shows him what became of his face. This upsets him so much he blasts all the others around. All the others have left, leaving only Face, Shan and Illyana behind. Illyana then reveals she only came back to save Shan, not the others.</p><h3>Rise of the New Mutants</h3><p>Emma Frost uses Cerebro to try to locate the missing New Mutants. She is unable to do so, but Pixie, Illyana, and Shan teleport into Cerebra and explain that the others have been taken to Limbo. Dani and the rest of the team remain trapped by the Inferno babies, while the soldiers of Project Purgatory prepare to use the bloodstone amulet to destroy Limbo. The X-Men gather and prepare to move out while Shan talks to Illyana.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1590871\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1206146709191\" data-width=\"3449\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3449px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1590871\"><img alt=\"New Mutants # 20\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 3449w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 571w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New Mutants # 20\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 3449w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1590871-untitled2.jpg 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New Mutants # 20</figcaption></figure><p>Shan deduces that Illyana is not bringing the X-Men on a rescue mission to Limbo. Illyana then proceeds to use her Soulsword on Shan and leaves her behind as the others prepare to leave for Limbo.</p><p>Demons gather at the Project Purgatory base, and a trio of leaders tries to negotiate with the soldiers. They are killed, and the demon army attacks. A group of demons attack Dani in her prison and accidentally release her. She then proceeds to fight back using a small knife she was known to carry in the original run of New Mutants.</p><p>Dani's jailer kills the remaining demons and comes looking for her. Dani then proceeds to shot her with an arrow from a bow she stole from one of the demons. Due to her broken arm, she uses her foot to hold the bow. One of the Inferno babies, Toko, is sent into the army of demons holding the amulet and the final bloodstone. She places the final stone into the amulet. Illyana then arrives at the earth base of Project Purgatory. It is then she realizes the Elder Gods have been released and they proceed to punch through the Limbo portal to get at her. Meanwhile back on Utopia, Shan enters Legion's mind. Legion is scared and tells Shan not to go in there. Shan tells Legion to stand back and draws the Soulsword from inside her. Shan opens a door marked Do Not Enter onto Legion's mindscape seen in the early issues of <a href=\"/new-mutants-return-of-legion/4050-32421/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32421\">volume 3</a>. It is then revealed that the Legion that has been in charge is not the real Legion, but another personality. The real Legion is locked up with what seems to be the rotting corpse of Bishop. He then says that Illyana told him previously that Shan would be back for the real Legion.</p><p>Back in Limbo, Dani frees Sam, Amara, and Roberto from their prison. Sam prepares to go find the amulet to try to avoid the <a href=\"/elder-gods/4060-52790/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52790\">Elder Gods</a> being released, unaware that it already happened. He gets incredibly angry and flies off to get vengeance. Amara and Roberto see Illyana on a dragon fighting demons. This is the Illyana that teleported in at the start of the series. Amara prepares to run and tell her what went wrong and what needs to be done to make it right. Roberto stops her, and she tries to trick him into letting her go off and hide alone; as a result of this she would die. Amara knows he is right but knows she needs to do it. Roberto then says he is going with her so she does not die alone. General Ulysses realizes the Elder Gods are attacking Earth and tries to command them to turn back. He is then killed by an Elder God, and the amulet is taken. Cyclops asks Illyana how to defeat the Elder Gods, but she simply states defeating the Elder Gods is beyond them.</p><p>Elsewhere, Roberto is preparing to make a path for Amara to get to the former Illyana to try to fix things. He powers up and runs into the fray, knowing it will be the death of him. As he falls he says goodbye to Amara and says that he loves her. This results in Magik feeling uncharacteristically sentimental at a time when she is focused on the Elder Gods. The feeling causes her to she transport the X-crew to the point where Roberto is about to be killed enabling Colossus to rescue him. Some of the Inferno babies attempt to escape on an underground train. Sam flies straight through the train car, effectively killing everyone on board.</p><p>Dani finds Cypher with the girl who took control of him. Earlier having been playing a strange instrument, it is revealed the machine plays magic. As a result, Doug was able to play a spell to free him from the girls' power and to remove her mouth, effectively killing her powers. Roberto then sacrifices himself to help Amara, being overcome by many demons. At this time, he also tells her that he loves her and goodbye. Illyana is talking to Cyclops when the real Legion appears in Limbo. Inside his head the good Legion, Shan, and Marci are protecting themselves from the chaos of Legion's mind, where Shan tells Marci not to worry because Illyana knows what she is doing. Legion then destroys the Elder Gods and the amulet, giving Illyana back the bloodstones.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1637068\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1729452054795\" data-width=\"584\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 584px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1637068\"><img alt=\"New Mutants # 21\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px\" data-width=\"545\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg 584w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg 545w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New Mutants # 21\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg 584w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1637068-nm213.jpg 545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px\" data-width=\"545\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New Mutants # 21</figcaption></figure><p>He then returns everything in Limbo to as it was before the Elder Gods were released. Back on Utopia it is revealed that Roberto is still alive as are Amara, Warlock, and Doug. Elsewhere, Dani questions Sam about if he caught up to the babies. When he remains silent, she asks him what he did. He stays silent and walks away, leaving Dani distraught.</p><p>Illyana returns Pixie's soul dagger and soul gems to her. Pixie then asks if Illyana got hers back and if it means Illyana is a real girl again. Illyana cryptically says she hopes to act like it does, if nothing else. Shan then talks to Illyana about how Legion got back to Earth. All Illyana does is give her a knowing look. Shan also asks if Illyana let the Elder Gods be released in order to get her vengeance. When Illyana says yes, Shan tells her she has to tell the others. Finally Shan asks what she gave Legion in return for helping her, to which Illyana replied, \"Everyone wants to come home, Shan. Even the worst of us.\" Illyana goes to her brother and tells him she is as she once was, whole and his little snowflake once more. Shadow is thrown on this statement by the look on Illyana's face as she hugs her brother.</p><h3>Unfinished Business</h3><p>After <a href=\"/age-of-x/4045-56282/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56282\">Age of X</a> Cyclops names Moonstar as the new leader of the New Mutants - now consisting of just Moonstar, Sunspot, Magma, Cypher, and Warlock - and charges the team with the new mission of tying up the X-Men's loose ends. Their first assignment: To find and bring home <a href=\"/x-man/4005-15051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15051\">X-Man</a>, Cyclops' son from an alternate reality who was last seen during <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a>.</p><p>The group begins their search in an abandoned H.A.M.M.E.R. Facility that's being excavated by <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain Steve Rogers</a> and <a href=\"/victoria-hand/4005-59261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59261\">Victoria Hand.</a> Rogers convinced Moonstar that the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> have already searched the facility, and there is no one here. However, as the Mutants leave, Cypher claims that there is in fact someone here, but he does not want to be found; reality is being warped in the facility. The Mutants manage to work past the warp, and find the <a href=\"/sugar-man/4005-3435/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3435\">Sugar Man</a> and his mutates holding X-Man hostage. Sugar Man has been holding X-Man in the Omega Machine, a device that <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> built to open portals to other realities, hoping that X-Man will open a portal to Sugar Man's home reality. Moonstar, Sunspot, and Magma battle Sugar Man and his lackeys, while Cypher and Warlock try to release X-Man from the Omega Machine. Eventually, X-Man uses all of his will and power to open a portal to Sugar Man's home reality, hoping that Sugar Man will now leave him alone. Sugar Man attempts to escape through the portal, but he is stopped and defeated by the New Mutants. He is taken into custody from Steve Rogers, his lackeys are moved to get their artificial powers removed, and X-Man is taken to Utopia. There, it is revealed after using his abilities to open the portal to Sugar Man's reality, X-Man's powers were mostly burnt out, and he now only has telekinesis. Cyclops welcomes X-Man to Utopia, hoping he will make it his new home.</p><p>Moonstar calls in her old friend <a href=\"/gus-grim/4005-16810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16810\">Gus Grim</a> a Cognitive Therapist from Colorado. Grim is known for his work in the Cheyenne communities, to help her \"damaged\" teammates. She first brings him to see Nate Grey, but Grim never talks to Grey, and instead recommends that Moonstar let him battle something \"real\" in the Danger Room so Grey can push himself. Grim then talks to Cannonball, who has put himself under psychiatric observation in a secure ward. Grim believes that Cannonball took himself out of a leadership position because he was too afraid of failing, and that he is still capable of leading if he was simply willing to put aside those feelings. He then goes to see Karma, who has stayed out of the field to be with Face, a sense deprived mutant whom she shares a psychic bond with. Grim tells Karma that there are any number of telepaths or empaths who could engage with Face, and the fact that she wants to do it alone is selfish of her. Lastly, Grim is taken to see Illyana, who is imprisoned because of her reckless actions in Purgatory. Before they can talk, however, Grim collapses as three demons from Purgatory burst from his body to rescue Illyana; Illyana has no intentions of leaving, however, as she wants to stay to regain her life and the trust of her friends. The demons are then killed by <a href=\"/danger/4005-40862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40862\">Danger</a> using a protocol designed by <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> for just such an occasion. Grim recovers from this ordeal, and Illyana explains that the demons used his body as a Trogan Horse to get into Utopia to rescue her.</p><p>As Grim gets ready to leave Utopia, Dani fears that his experiences have put him off from doing regular sessions with her teammates, but Grim is surprised that Dani would even want him to do more sessions after how hard he went into her teammates. Dani explains that what Gus was doing is exactly what her teammates need; they're X-Men, and the life of an X-Man is too quick to spend time sitting around moping. Grim agrees to do weekly sessions, and he leaves Utopia. In the Danger Room, Nate has turned off the safety protocols, and he is quickly getting overwhelmed. Thankfully, he is saved by <a href=\"/hope-summers/4005-49329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\">Hope</a> who up to this point had refused to even meet X-Man due to his connection with <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a>. She offers to teach Nate some non-power based combat techniques that Cable taught her, and Nate agrees as the two begin training.</p><h3>X-Men: Regenesis</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977034-x-men-regenesis-new-mutants-33-revealed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977034\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2977034-x-men-regenesis-new-mutants-33-revealed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2977034\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977034-x-men-regenesis-new-mutants-33-revealed.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977034-x-men-regenesis-new-mutants-33-revealed.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977034-x-men-regenesis-new-mutants-33-revealed.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/74068/2977034-x-men-regenesis-new-mutants-33-revealed.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a></figure><p>During the <a title=\"X-Men: Regenesis\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Regenesis\" rel=\"nofollow \">Regenesis</a> event, the New Mutants, with the exception of Cannonball and Karma, choose to join Cyclops' side, but rather than remain on Utopia, they establish a new base at the 1128 Mission Street in San Francisco in order to better integrate themself with the rest of humanity . With the departure of Cannonball and Karma to New York and Magik's assignment to Cyclops' Extinction Team, the team added <a title=\"Nate Grey\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Grey\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nate Grey</a> to the roster, all under the leadership of Dani Moonstar.</p><p>The new teams consists of Moonstar, Nate Grey, Magma, Cypher, Warlock and Sunspot. In addition to the team the reoccurring character <a href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\">Blink</a> makes quite an appearance throughout the series. After being resurrected by Selene Blink has been a rogue mutant. Although not hurting anyone she has been leaving teleportation whole around the world and the New Mutants are assigned to see what is causing this effect. The New Mutants team up with Blink and they stop the destruction. Unfortunately Blink choose to attend Wolverine's <a href=\"/jean-grey-school-for-higher-learning/4020-57624/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57624\">Jean Grey School for Higher Learning </a> after giving the choice to join the New Mutants or them. However she still makes an appearance throughout the series as she relates well with the New Mutants.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-811 (Days of Future Past)</h3><p>In this despotic future time line, overrun by mutant killing Sentinels, the New Mutants still thrive and is still a team composed to mutant youths learning the proper use of their powers. Led by an older, war-torn Banshee, now wearing a patch and cybernetic limbs replacing ones lost. The New Mutants of this reality had a rough existence, never knowing when another Sentinel attack was going to happen. This New Mutants team consisted of:</p><p><b><a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a> (Scrape):</b> the son of the Fantastic Fours Sue and Reed Richards. He was the field team leader.</p><p><b><a href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers</a>:</b> the telekinetic daughter of Jean Grey and Cyclops and girlfriend/future wife of Franklin.</p><p><b><a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Douglas Ramsey</a> (Magus):</b> the only member to stay on the team from the original New Mutants but very different from who he used to be. Due to his connection to Warlock he could get and be consumed by the Techno-Organic Virus. Being that he took that name \"Magus\" it can be assumed that he killed Warlock as well.</p><p><b>Blue:</b> the daughter of Nightcrawler and Amanda Sefton.</p><p>Blaze &amp; another unnamed member: no information was revealed of their lineage.</p><p>Though their fate as a team was unrevealed, it can be assumed that the New Mutants of this time line ended tragically as Franklin and Rachel are two of the last living mutants in America and in a mutant concentration camp and Banshee's gravestone are shown in front of the camp indicating his death at the hands of the Sentinels. It’s likely that the other members too met the deaths in this apocalyptic future but nothing is certain.</p><p>A divergent reality similar to the Days of Future Past.</p><h3>New Mutants #49-50</h3><p>Most of the X-Men, if not all, and the New Mutants were killed by Sentinels in their initial attack. The New Mutants are now a trio consisting of three individuals: a now aged <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a>, his lover <a href=\"/lila-cheney/4005-4556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4556\">Lila Cheney</a> and a very embittered and war torn <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Danielle Moonstar</a>. They devised a plan to gather the remaining mutants together and use Lila's intergalactic teleportation powers to safely leave Earth and head to another planet. It appears that they are successful in their attempts as they are shown teleporting away in one of the final panels.</p><h3>Earth-1081</h3><p>Homeworld of <a href=\"/morph/4005-12547/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12547\">Morph</a>, previously a member of the Exiles.</p><p>The New Mutants of this reality were/are very similar to the mainstream counterpart of Earth #616 with an exception to the members of the team.

Cannonball, Wolfsbane, Magma, Sunspot, Iceman, Jubilee, Berserker and Multiple Man are the new under class at Xavier's Institute and are called the New Mutants. Boom-Boom also became a member but became cold in the team as she was persuaded by her father to commit crime. She then temporarily became one of the Brotherhood. They undergo trainings together with the X-Men. At first, these New Mutants are not interested in schooling as they do not follow Jean Grey and Scott Summers' orders. For them to realize how important studying is for an X-Man, Jean levitated all of them with her telekinesis. Scott then used his optic blast to reflect through the walls and amaze the students as he sliced an apple with his optic blast. They also have messed with the Blackbird for having a joyride when they used it for fun. They drove the Blackbird recklessly putting them into danger. Following some events, Kitty Pryde and Kurt Wagner have decided to have a party in the Institute as they invite their friends from Bayville. When the X-Men discovered about this, they got scolded. After the people found out about the mutants, Wolfsbane and Jubilee left the Institute. Cannonball became closer to Wolverine as he races with him with their motorcycles. Some boys also opens up to Wolverine about them disliking their studies especially of Physics.During an encounter with a mutant who was named Dani Moonstar, she projected herself into Kitty's mind with a ghost shaft. In Kitty's imaginings, Dani became a member of the New Mutants. Dani have complications in controlling her powers at first and caused trouble to the minds of their teachers. However, it was revealed that Dani is unconscious while projecting herself to Kitty after the X-men and the New Mutants have saved her. She was then picked up by her grandfather Black Eagle. During the final battle against Apocalypse, Magneto, Mystique, Storm and Professor X were converted into Apocalypse's horseman. Each of the New Mutants were given different missions in different base of operations. Wolfsbane and Sunspot were along other mutants in Mexico to fight Magneto. Though, the united forces of the mutants have not succeeded against him. Wolfsbane, Sunspot and other mutants were seen unconscious after their fight and only Wanda, Kitty and the Brotherhood were left to fight him. Multiple Man and Magma were sent to Egypt to help Jean's team defeat Professor X. Using her powers, Amara created a fissure with magma inside it and Multiple Man duplicated himself into lots of duplicates while firing Xavier, however, most of his duplicates were defeated. Boom-Boom then created gigantic explosives for Colossus to throw on Xavier. Iceman and Berserker along with Spyke and Beast went to China to face Storm. Storm attacked them and Iceman created an ice cave to shield them. Berserker was then able to knock Storm out. But using her powers to make it rain, Berserker have electrified himself and went unconscious. Cannonball then accompanied Rogue to fetch Leech and borrow his powers to turn Apocalypse's machine off. He carried Rogue and fled inside the pyramid. Following the defeat of the aforementioned villain, anything was back to normal. In Professor X's vision about the X-Men, Jubilee have returned in the Institute and the New Mutants continued studying at Xavier's.</p><h3>Movies</h3><h4>The New Mutants (2018)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111253019/6107408-7870162054-th\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6107408\" data-ratio=\"0.56333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111253019/6107408-7870162054-th\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6107408\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/6107408-7870162054-th\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/6107408-7870162054-th 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/6107408-7870162054-th\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/6107408-7870162054-th 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In May of 2015 it was announced that director Josh Boone was set to direct a live action adaption of the New Mutants, being based on the classic stories by Chris Claremont.

The Mutants are comprised of a lizard/snake humanoid, an ape humanoid, and a jackal humanoid. Somehow the Mutants are going to blow up Thundera, and the nobles of this world are fleeing in a spaceship. These nobles become the main characters in this series.

      "description": "<p>The Challengers of the Unknown is a group of fictional characters first drawn by <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> for DC Comics. This quartet of adventurers explored science fictional and apparent paranormal occurrences and faced fantastic menaces. The scripts for the first stories are often credited to Dick and <a href=\"/dave-wood/4040-48163/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-48163\">Dave Wood</a>, two brothers who also wrote other Kirby-illustrated material, such as the \"Sky Masters of the Space Force\" comic strip; but others have claimed that Kirby created the Challengers himself or together with former partner <a href=\"/joe-simon/4040-9443/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9443\">Joe Simon</a>. The Challengers are said to be part of the inspiration for the creation of the Fantastic Four at Marvel Comics.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s DC Comics used the ongoing series Showcase to introduce or re-imagine characters that they would then base a directorial decision about how to proceed with the characters whether they would be placed in their own series, take over other well established, introduced as supporting characters elsewhere, or simply be allowed to fade away. Among the more popular of the characters introduced here were the Atom and the Flash, but other characters went on to a degree of their own popularity. Once such group of characters was the Challengers of the Unknown who have maintained a constant if not overwhelming popularity at DC in the years since their introduction. The group debuted in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/showcase-6-the-secret-of-the-sorcerers-box/4000-2860/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-2860\">Showcase #6</a> (February 1957) as acquaintances who miraculously survived a plane crash unscathed. They concluded that since they were \"living on borrowed time\", they should band together for hazardous adventures. The four — <a href=\"/ace-morgan/4005-16338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16338\">Kyle \"Ace\" Morgan</a>, <a href=\"/red-ryan/4005-23645/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23645\">Matthew \"Red\" Ryan</a>, <a href=\"/rocky-davis/4005-16340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16340\">Leslie \"Rocky\" Davis</a>, and <a href=\"/prof-haley/4005-24284/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24284\">Walter Mark \"Prof\" Haley</a> — became the Challengers of the Unknown.</p><p>The inspiration for the Challengers' adventures were old serials, war movies, and drive-in science fiction. Superhero comics had mostly vanished by the mid-1950s; the revival of the <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a>, often seen as marking the return of the super-heroes to popularity, had occurred only a few months earlier, in Showcase #4. As larger-than-life heroes without super-powers but having super-adventures, the Challengers helped pave the way for the 1960's superheroes. Like war movies, their \"squad\" had the standard archetypes: Ace, the hotshot pilot and leader; Rocky, strong and dumb; Prof, the skinny brain; and Red, the hothead daredevil. The stories had weird menaces, fistfights, wild vehicles and gadgets, spectacular terrain, daring escapes, and a sense of humor.</p><p>The most noted influence of this creation was Kirby's next major continuing series, <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4050-2045/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2045\">The Fantastic Four</a>, which was essentially the Challengers as a superhero family, complete with a similar origin. Both groups were quartets who resolved to band together after a crash landing; but the Challengers lacked the strong characterizations and much of the humor that distinguished the Fantastic Four. In \"Challengers of the Unknown\" #3, Rocky was shot into space and returned with multiple superpowers including invisibility, flame throwing, freeze-ray throwing, giant-growth, super-speed and super-strength.</p><p>The series continued in <a href=\"/showcase/4050-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1770\">Showcase</a> for three more appearances (#7, 11, 12) then moved to its own title, considered among Kirby's most notable in that period. After 12 issues total, Kirby moved on, and while the title continued through issue #75 (Aug.-Sept. 1970, followed by intermittent reprint and revival issues from 1973-78), the series never achieved the same level of acclaim. It was a typical DC B-List comic, a steady seller like the <a href=\"/doom-patrol/4050-2177/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2177\">Doom Patrol</a> and <a href=\"/sea-devils/4050-2033/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2033\">Sea Devils</a>.</p><p>Soon famous, the Challengers accepted many \"unknown challenges\" from the Pentagon, mad scientists, and people with a problem. Over time the \"Challs\" established the hollowed-out Challengers Mountain as headquarters. Later they adopted an hourglass logo to symbolize time running out. They encountered genies, common and sophisticated thieves, rocs, aliens and robots good and bad, mad scientists, and super villains. Their adventures followed the flow of other DC comics starting with \"Strange Adventures\", veering toward super heroics (during the Bat Craze), to occult menaces, through Bermuda Triangle weirdness, and finally to cancellation (1979). The Challengers traveled through space, time, and other dimensions. Guest stars included the <a href=\"/doom-patrol/4060-5701/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5701\">Doom Patrol</a>, <a href=\"/deadman/4005-5690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5690\">Deadman</a>, <a href=\"/swamp-thing/4005-15809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15809\">Swamp Thing</a>, <a href=\"/jonny-double/4005-34764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34764\">Jonny Double</a>, and <a href=\"/sea-devils/4060-56085/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56085\">Sea Devils</a>.</p><p>During a one issue crossover story with the Sea Devils in <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown-47-the-sinister-sponge-/4000-8201/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-8201\">Challengers of the Unknown #47</a> they fought the criminal group known as Scorpio. <a href=\"/june-robbins/4005-24164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24164\">June Robbins</a>, a computer genius and archaeologist, joined the Challengers for many adventures as an \"honorary\" or \"girl\" Challenger, starting in their appearances in Showcase.</p><p>In a short-lived 1977 revival, the Challengers were a four-man, one-woman team again. The first came back in Super-Team Family #8-10, before getting their own title back with <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown-81-multi-mans-master-pl/4000-175665/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-175665\">Challengers of the Unknown #81</a>. They were joined by Deadman and Swamp Thing. June Robbins got a uniform and official status. No explanation for June's joining was given.</p><p>Their title was canceled with <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown-87-twelve-million-years/4000-175670/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-175670\">Challengers of the Unknown #87</a> in 1978, but they continued their storyline in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/4050-3105/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3105\">Adventure Comics</a> #493-497. They also appeared in issues of <a href=\"/super-team-family/4050-2741/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2741\">Super-Team Family</a>.</p><h2>Volume 2</h2><p>The Challengers were revamped with a \"Dark Knight\" cast in Volume 2 (1991) by <a href=\"/jeph-loeb/4040-40472/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40472\">Jeph Loeb</a> and <a href=\"/tim-sale/4040-5543/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5543\">Tim Sale</a>. The Challs were semi-retired, their mountain a theme park, and their adventures disregarded as cooked-up articles in \"The Tattletale\". Other-dimensional experiments and a bomb blew up the mountain and nearby town. Prof and June were presumed killed. Red, Rocky, and Ace were tried and ordered to disband. The three drifted apart, dogged by a ghostly Prof and June, then reunited to defeat a space-demon causing worldwide suicides and madness. \"The New Challengers of the Unknown\", including ghostly Prof and June, were poised to take on menaces in the dark corners of the DCU. Loeb planned a second miniseries to reset the Challs to youth and heroism, but it never materialized.</p><p>The mini series was 8 issues. It was reprinted in trade paperback as Challengers of the Unknown Must Die! in 2004.</p><h2>Volume 3</h2><p>The Challengers were revamped again by <a href=\"/steven-grant/4040-41567/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41567\">Steven Grant</a> in Volume 3 (1997). Four new Challengers pursued X-Files-like horrors. They were <a href=\"/clay-brody/4005-23544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23544\">Clay Brody</a>, NASCAR driver; <a href=\"/brenda-ruskin/4005-23787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23787\">Brenda Ruskin</a>, physicist; <a href=\"/kenn-kawa/4005-23545/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23545\">Kenn Kawa</a>, radical games designer; and <a href=\"/marlon-corbet/4005-23592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23592\">Marlon Corbet</a>, commercial pilot, who also miraculously survived a plane crash. They stopped sacrificial wackos, drug-juiced zombies, vengeful ghosts, Amazon cults, Lovecraftian monsters, mass suicides, humming buildings, and other oddities. They were advised by Rocky Davis, older and grayer and alone. It was eventually revealed the original Challengers were dematerialized by a mad scientist's ray-weapon. The same ray caused both plane crashes, as well as others. Soon the original Challs reappeared, helped the young Challs defeat the madman, then walked back into oblivion (minus a wounded Rocky) to shut down a runaway Tesla field. The young Challengers vowed to fight on - until cancellation in 1998 with issue #18.</p><p>The missing Challengers - Ace, Red, Prof, and June - were discovered by <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a> in Hypertime. The team was waging guerrilla war against <a href=\"/black-zero/4005-17785/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17785\">Black Zero</a> (a Superboy variant). With Black Zero defeated, the team returned to Earth, but lost Red Ryan along the way. Reunited with Rocky in <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a>, hosted by <a href=\"/rip-hunter/4005-4937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4937\">Rip Hunter</a>, the original Challengers vowed to explore Hypertime, \"the greatest unknown,\" to find Red.</p><p>Two Challengers partook in Infinite Crisis. Rocky Davis and Prof Haley helped stem the escape of prisoners from Blackgate Prison (Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special 1) and Rocky fought in the Battle for Metropolis (Infinite Crisis 7).</p><h2>New 52</h2><p>In 2011, DC Comics rebooted their universe as The New 52. The Challengers of the Unknown were featured in issues 6, 7, and 8 of DC Universe Presents where they are working for Morgan Edge as Reality TV adventurists.</p><h2>Other Info</h2><p>In <a href=\"/amalgam-comics/4010-2014/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2014\">Amalgam Comics</a>, the Challengers were amalgamated with their super-powered counterparts, the Fantastic Four, to form the <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-fantastic/4060-57062/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57062\">Challengers of the Fantastic</a>.</p><p>In 2010, the Challengers of the Unknown where also seen in Justice League of America #42 back in the past where they found a alien weapon that can whip out their minds. The Challengers of the Unknown called the Metal Men to take care of the problem before anyone gets hurt.</p><h2>Media</h2><p>The Challengers of the Unknown are seen in the teaser for the episode \"Revenge of The Reach!\". They find a crashed space pod, and as they investigate they are attacked and controlled by mini Starros.</p>",

The previous incarnation of Avengers were very much like their Earth-616 counterparts until they learned of a monumental threat from the reality of Earth-9907.</p><p>In this reality, the Nazis won World War II and the ruler of the entire world was <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Victor Von Doom</a> (known to Earth-616 as Dr.Doom). He was on the verge of mastering a Universal Cube which would allow him to invade other realities. Earth-982's Avengers created a portal into Earth-9907 in which to stop Doom. The confronted their counterparts in that world known as the <a href=\"/thunder-guard/4060-56124/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56124\">Thunder Guard</a>, this universe's twisted version of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> under Doom's control.</p><p>Many Avengers of Earth-928 perished during that battle with the Thunder Guard, but they did succeed in slowing down Doom's plan. One of the few survivors, Captain America stayed behind in Earth-9907 to lead the local resistance against Doom. Only six Avengers returned to earth: <a href=\"/clint-barton/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye (Clint Barton)</a> whom had been blinded in battle; <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules,</a>whom was driven mad by his experiences and had to be sealed in an <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium</a> prison; the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a>; <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">the Vision</a> whom later became adviser to the U.S President; <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">the Wasp</a> who was distraught over the death of her husband <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a>; and <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>.</p><p>To prevent any further interaction with Earth-9906, Iron Man was forced to place the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> into a stasis field and used her powers to seal the rift.
