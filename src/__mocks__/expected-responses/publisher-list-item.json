Companies tried different approaches, One that succeeded and often outsold DC for instance was <a href=\"/fawcett-publications/4010-34/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-34\">Fawcett Publications</a> who had a character who some consider similar to <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> who was an all-powerful hero with a supporting \"family\" known as <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/billy-batson/4005-2350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2350\">Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family,</a> whereas other companies such as <a href=\"/charlton/4010-125/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-125\">Charlton Comics</a> created entire new worlds preventing DC from attacking them with lawsuits. Further along in the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age</a> many of these companies failed or like Fawcett were sued out of existence. Thus although they had once been competitors, many of the soon public domain properties of Fawcett and Charlton were eventually revived and trademarked and seemingly taken under DC's control.</p><h3>Silver &amp; Bronze Age</h3><p>During the post-War years, the popularity of superheroes had declined almost completely, though DC and other publishers were still going strong moving into other genres such as funny animals, romance, Sci-Fi, Westerns and horror. Major characters such as Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman has managed to remain in publication and by the mid-1950s the superhero was again due for a comeback. <a href=\"/showcase-4-mystery-of-the-human-thunderbolt-the-ma/4000-2653/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-2653\"><em>Showcase #4</em></a> in 1956 introduced readers to Barry Allen, the all-new Flash re-imagined with a sleeker design and steeped much heavier in science fiction (an the older Golden Age heroes being relegated to existing on Earth Two). Characters such as The Atom, Green Lantern and the JSA, now reinvented as the Justice League of America soon followed and a new superhero boom was kicked off.</p><p>During this time, The <a href=\"/comics-code-authority/4015-42382/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42382\">Comics Code Authority</a> has also come into play, which drastically subdued the content available in the comic book medium. Many of the stories during the period moved away from more controversial horror or violent themes.</p><p>With the re-invigoration of Marvel in the 1960s under the leadership of <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>, DC found itself a new and more potent competitor. Marvel succeeded by breaking what had become by then generic archetypes of superheroes by introducing characters which were younger and more flawed (and thus appeared more human and appealed to a younger crowd in a more direct manner.) After falling behind Marvel in sales, DC was finally forced to adopt much of the same system which Marvel had, by introducing such young teams as the <a href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\">Teen Titans</a> to compete with the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>.</p><h3>Modern Age &amp; Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148518/2959713-dc%20previews%20poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2959713\" data-ratio=\"1.3491436100132\" data-width=\"759\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 759px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148518/2959713-dc%20previews%20poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2959713\"><img alt=\"The Modern Age\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/14/148518/2959713-dc%20previews%20poster.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/14/148518/2959713-dc%20previews%20poster.jpg 759w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/14/148518/2959713-dc%20previews%20poster.jpg 711w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\" data-width=\"711\"></a><figcaption>The Modern Age</figcaption></figure><p>In 1985, DC Comics decided its 50 years of continuity and numerous alternative Earths had become too messy and was in need of new blank slate. DC penned one of the first major comic book crossovers that incorporated almost every DC title and character ever published by the company. The series ended with multiple Earths being erased and merging into to one unified Earth. Following this, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were given new leases of life thanks to big name creators such as John Byrne, Frank Miller and <a href=\"/george-perez/4040-2913/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2913\">George Perez</a> that redefined the elderly heroes for a new generation.</p><p>During this same period, the comic audience has begun to grow up and the direct market for comic stores had opened allowing a wider variety of publications to be experimented with. One such experiment involved bringing in British writer Alan Moore to pen the low selling <em>Saga of the Swamp Thing</em> series. What resulted was style of comic book not experienced before by mainstream readers in its literary and story driven complexity and execution. Before long, other writers from across the pond such as Neil Gaiman, Peter Milligan and Grant Morrison were recruited to revamp obscure properties and tell new and interesting stories with an older audience in mind. 1986 saw the release of two seminal works from DC Comics, Frank Miller's <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> and Alan Moore's <em>Watchmen</em> that reached unprecedented levels of critical acclaim and outside media attention. By the 90's DC and the entire comic book industry experienced a boom in mature comics aimed at older audiences and simultaneously witnessed a collector's boom that increased sales but almost caused the industry to collapse soon after.</p><p>In 1993, senior editor Karen Berger convinced DC to make her own imprint for mature readers named <a href=\"/vertigo/4010-521/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-521\">Vertigo</a>, similar to DC imprints <a href=\"/piranha-press/4010-2083/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2083\">Piranha Press</a> and <a href=\"/paradox-press/4010-1982/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1982\">Paradox Press</a> as well as Marvel's <a href=\"/epic/4010-300/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-300\">Epic Comics</a>. Using popular titles such as <a href=\"/animal-man/4050-3976/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3976\"><em>Animal Man</em></a>, <a href=\"/swamp-thing/4050-3465/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3465\"><em>Swamp Thing</em></a>, <a href=\"/hellblazer/4050-4008/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4008\"><em>Hellblazer</em></a>, <a href=\"/the-sandman/4050-4207/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4207\"><em>The Sandman</em></a> and <a href=\"/shade-the-changing-man/4050-4375/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4375\"><em>Shade, The Changing Man</em></a> as its blueprint along side new creator owned material, DC/Vertigo became a hub for intelligent and acclaimed comic books. While rival Marvel Comics continued to dominate the publishing arena with their exceedingly popular properties, DC/Vertigo became the destination for literary and inventive titles during the period.</p><p>In 1999, DC purchased Jim Lee's <a href=\"/wildstorm/4010-708/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-708\">WildStorm Productions</a>, formerly one of the founding studios of <a href=\"/image/4010-513/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-513\">Image</a>. The line of WildStorm comics and properties came under DC's control though the line continued to be published on the West Coast away from DC editorial until 2010.</p><h3>All Star DC Comics</h3><p>In 2000 Marvel Comics started an imprint called ultimate marvel in which the characters' origin is changed and modernized. This eventually led DC to starting an imprint of their own in 2005, thus All Star was born.</p><p>Both All-Star series are in their own continuity, except <em>All-Star Batman and Robin</em> which was part of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/earth-31/4020-57575/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57575\">Earth- 31</a>.</p><p><strong>All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder</strong></p><p><em>All-Star Batman</em> started in 2005 and was written by Frank Miller and Penciled by Jim Lee. This was the first series in the All Star imprint and opened to mainly negative reviews but had high sales. The series was released in a sporadic schedule. The series only reached 10 issues (2008) 2 issues before the intended end of the series.</p><p><strong>All Star Superman</strong></p><p><em>All-Star Superman</em> started in 2006 and was written by Grant Morrison and Penciled by Frank Quitley. This was the second series under the All Star imprint, the first being <em>All-Star Batman and Robin</em>. The series opened to mainly good reviews and went on to win the Eisner Award for best new series in 2006 and best ongoing series in 2007 and 2009. Like <em>All-Star Batman</em> the series was also released in a sporadic schedule. The series ended with issue 12. The series overall has widely considered to be one of the best Superman stories of all time.</p><h3>The New 52</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1837076\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73469387755102\" data-width=\"490\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 490px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1837076\"><img alt=\"Justice League # 1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 490w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Justice League # 1\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 490w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Justice League # 1</figcaption></figure><p>In 2011, after a period of declining comic sales, DC announced they were cancelling all the main titles and starting over with all <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">New 52's</a> as part of a relaunch. In charge of the relaunch is <a href=\"/geoff-johns/4040-40439/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40439\">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\">Jim Lee</a>. The relaunch started with the release of <a href=\"/justice-league-justice-league-part-one/4000-290431/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290431\"><em>Justice League</em> # 1</a> on August 31st. this was done partially to revitalize the company and to de-age the characters and thus make them more dynamic. On January 12, 2012, it was announced that there would be a second wave of the new 52 where six titles would be getting canceled with another six to replace them, though the plan to stay at 52 ongoing monthlies seems to be consistent. DC also released a Third wave in September 2012, one year after the relaunch in September 2011. One book in the Third Wave, <em>Talon</em>, starring Calvin Rose was the first solo book for a character who was introduced in the New 52. The Fourth wave started in January 2013 and ended in March 2013, meaning that it was the first wave not to come out in a single month. The Fifth Wave consisted of titles such as <em>the Movement</em>, <em>the Green Team</em> and <em>Superman Unchained</em>.</p><p>The New 52 had proved to be so successful with critics, fans and commercially that Marvel the main competitor of DC decided to do a relaunch of their own called \"<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/marvel-now/4015-56129/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56129\">Marvel NOW!</a>\" in late 2012.</p><h2><strong>Relocating from Manhattan to Burbank</strong></h2><p>In 2015, DC Entertainment moved their entire operations from their Manhattan headquarters in New York City to their new home in Burbank, California. DC's digital and administrative departments had already been relocated to Burbank beginning in 2010. The new office is only a few blocks from their corporate parent company, Warner Bros.

The original members were The Clock, Manhunter, Midnight, and Destiny. The Unknown, Spider Widow, Wildfire, and Destiny were characters that were based on their 1940's counter-parts. Joe Hercules and Stormy Foster appeared in Golden Age a DC Elseworlds title. Stormy would later make his New 52 debut in Earth 2.

There was a character named Mouthpiece in the 1999 Doctor Midnight mini series; it is unknown if he is related to the Quality character of the same name. Image Comics reimagned the Golden Age characters and published Crack Comics #63 as an anthology one shot around 2008. Most of the characters are owned by DC may have lapsed into the Public Domain. The characters story arcs that continued were The Mouthpiece, Molly the Model, Alias the Spider, Wildfire, and Captain Triumph.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>Fox Feature Syndicate</b> (also known as <b>Fox Comics</b> and <b>Fox Publications</b>) was an early comic book publisher in the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age of Comic Books</a>. Founded by entrepreneur <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/victor-fox/4040-49436/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-49436\">Victor S. Fox</a>, it produced such popular titles as <a href=\"/the-blue-beetle/4050-19402/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19402\">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"/fantastic-comics/4050-19504/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19504\">Fantastic Comics</a> and <a href=\"/mystery-men-comics/4050-20530/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20530\">Mystery Men Comics</a>.</p><p>It is unrelated to the company Fox Publications, a Colorado publisher of railroad photography books.</p><p>Victor S. Fox and business associate Bob Farrell launched Fox Feature Syndicate at 480 Lexington Avenue in New York City in the late 1930s. For content, Fox contracted with comics packager <a href=\"/will-eisner/4040-26686/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-26686\">Eisner</a> &amp; <a href=\"/s-m-jerry-iger/4040-41635/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41635\">Iger</a>, one of a handful of companies creating comic books on demand for publishers then entering the field. Writer-artist Will Eisner, at Victor Fox's request for a hero similar to the newly published hit <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, created the superhero <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-73295/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73295\">Wonder Man</a> for Fox's first publication, <em><a href=\"/wonder-comics-1-the-wrath-of-allah/4000-233637/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-233637\">Wonder Comics #1</a></em> (May 1939), signing his work \"Willis\". Superman owner <a href=\"/national-periodical-publications/4010-24/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-24\">National Periodical Publications</a>, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, cited copyright infringement and quickly obtained a permanent injunction. Wonder Man did not reappear.</p><p>After Eisner testified against Fox Publications at trial, Victor Fox dropped the packager and hired his own stable of comic creators, beginning with a New York Times classified ad on Dec. 2, 1939. <a href=\"/joe-simon/4040-9443/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9443\">Joe Simon</a>, a former Eisner &amp; Iger freelancer, became Fox Publications' editor.</p><p>As one of the earliest companies in the emerging field, it employed or bought the packaged material of a huge number of Golden Age greats, many at the start of their careers. <a href=\"/lou-fine/4040-24756/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-24756\">Lou Fine</a> created the superhero <a href=\"/the-flame/4005-24757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24757\">The Flame</a> in <a href=\"/wonderworld-comics/4050-20532/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20532\">Wonderworld Comics</a>; <a href=\"/dick-briefer/4040-43461/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43461\">Dick Briefer</a> created <a href=\"/rex-dexter/4005-17833/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17833\">Rex Dexter of Mars</a> in the eponymous series. <a href=\"/george-tuska/4040-9435/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9435\">George Tuska</a> did his first comics work here with the features \"Zanzibar\" (<a href=\"/mystery-men-comics-1-the-case-of-tintypes-will-the/4000-122950/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-122950\"><em>Mystery Men Comics #1</em></a>, Aug. 1939) and \"Tom Barry\" (<a href=\"/wonderworld-comics-4-ambushing-the-smoky-hill-stag/4000-123263/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-123263\"><em>Wonderworld Comics #4</em></a>). <a href=\"/fletcher-hanks/4040-56582/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-56582\">Fletcher Hanks</a> created, wrote, and drew <a href=\"/stardust-the-super-wizard/4005-27007/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27007\">Stardust the Super Wizard</a> in Fantastic Comics in 1939 and 1940. <a href=\"/matt-baker/4040-27899/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-27899\">Matt Baker</a>, one of the few African-American comic book artists of the Golden Age, revamped — in more than one sense — the newly acquired <a href=\"/quality-comics/4010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-15\">Quality Comics</a> character <a href=\"/phantom-lady/4050-26918/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26918\">Phantom Lady</a>' in 1947, creating one of the most memorable and controversial examples of superhero \"good girl art\".</p><p>Future comics legend <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>, brought on staff here after freelancing for Eisner &amp; Iger, wrote and drew the syndicated newspaper comic strip The Blue Beetle (starting Jan. 1940), starring a character created by <a href=\"/charles-nicholas/4040-39294/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-39294\">Charles Nicholas Wojtkowski</a> in <em>Mystery Men Comics #1</em> (Aug. 1939). Kirby retained the house name \"Charles Nicholas\" for the comic strip, which lasted three months. Kirby, additionally, created and did one story each of the Fox features \"<a href=\"/wing-turner/4005-79866/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79866\">Wing Turner</a>\" (<a href=\"/mystery-men-comics-10/4000-122984/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-122984\"><em>Mystery Men #10</em></a>, May 1940) and \" <a href=\"/cosmic-carson/4005-73810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73810\">Cosmic Carson</a>\" (<a href=\"/science-comics-4/4000-197120/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-197120\"><em>Science Comics #4</em></a>, same month).</p><p>Throughout the 1940s, Fox produced comics in a typically wide variety of genres, but was best known for superheroes and humor. With the post-war decline in superheroes' popularity, Fox, like other publishers, concentrated on horror and crime comics, including some of the most notorious of the latter. Following the establishment of <a href=\"/comics-code-authority/4015-42382/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42382\">Comics Code Authority</a> in the mid-1950s, Fox went out of business, selling the rights to the Blue Beetle to <a href=\"/charlton/4010-125/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-125\">Charlton Comics</a>.</p><p>Born in England, Fox Publications founder Victor S. Fox was a stockbroker for the Allied Capital Corp./Fox Motor and Bank Stocks, Inc./American Common Stocks, Inc., on Park Avenue in New York City when he was [indicted citation needed] on Nov. 27, 1929 for mail fraud and related illegal \"boiler room\" activities. It appears unrecorded whether this resulted in a conviction.</p><p>Historian Jon Berk rumors that Fox went on to become an accountant/bookkeeper at the publishing firm that would become DC Comics, where he was privy to sales figures that convinced him to launch his own comic-book company. Fellow historian <a href=\"/gerard-jones/4040-41475/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41475\">Gerard Jones</a>, writing in his book Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book, was unable to find documentation of this. Other sources say that at the time <em><a href=\"/action-comics-1-superman-champion-of-the-oppressed/4000-105403/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-105403\">Action Comics #1</a></em> came out he was publishing Astrology magazines and shared a distributor with DC after seeing a sales card receipt for Action #1 he Immediately opened Fox comics in the same building DC was based in on a different floor.</p><p><b>Jack Kirby</b>: \"Victor Fox was a character. He'd look up at the ceiling with a big cigar, this little fellow, very broad, going back and forth with his hands behind his back saying, 'I'm the King of Comics! I'm the King of Comics!' and we would watch him and, of course, smile a little because he was a genuine type\".</p><p><a href=\"/joe-simon/4040-9443/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9443\"><b>Joe Simon</b></a> on Victor Fox : \"He was an accountant for DC Comics. He was doing the sales figures and he liked what he saw. So, he moved downstairs and started his own company.... I happened to get a job; I went over to Fox and became editor there, which was just an impossible job, because ... there were no artists, no writers, no editors, no letterers — nothing there. Everything came out of the Eisner and Iger shop. ... He was a very strange character. He had kind of a British accent; he was like 5'2\", told us he was a former ballroom dancer. He was very loud, menacing, and really a scary little guy. He used to say, 'I'm the King of the Comics. I'm the King of the Comics. I'm the King of the Comics.' We couldn't stop him\".</p><p><b>Nicky Wright</b>: \"Competing well in the 'most sexy, sadistic, and violent' category, Victor Fox’s Murder Incorporated and Blue Beetle are noteworthy.... When historians describe sleaze, sex, and violence as Fox’s obsession, they are masters of understatement. His best artists, Jack Kamen and Matt Baker, are much revered and collected for their good girl art. (Of special note is the company’s breasty crime-fighter-in-bedroom-lingerie, Phantom Lady...along with the wild and scantily attired Rulah, Jungle Goddess.)\"</p><p><b>Boyd Magers</b>: \"Never one to overlook a secondary sale, Fox often repackaged four remaindered (unsold) comics into a 25¢ Giant with a new cover, hence Hoot Gibson's Western Roundup, 132 pages dated 1950. However, since Fox always started their stories on the inside front cover (where other publishers ran an ad), these repackaged comics are always missing the first page of story content. Also, since Fox used remaindered issues, contents will vary from copy to copy of Hoot Gibson's Western Roundup.\"</p><p>Dynamite Entertainment has revived a few of the Fox Feature Syndicate characters

      "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p>The Atlas comic company began in the 1950's after it changed it's name from <a href=\"/timely/4010-21/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-21\"> Timely</a> Comics to Atlas. <a href=\"/martin-goodman/4040-43801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\"> Martin Goodman</a>, the creator of Timely Comics, used Atlas as the name of his comic books during the 1950's.  It was located in the Empire State Building.  While Timely Comics focused more on superheroes and funny cartoon comics, Atlas often published a bit more darker subjects such as horror, crime, and thriller comics. Famous Marvel titles such as<a href=\"/journey-into-mystery/4050-1497/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1497\"> Journey Into Mystery</a>, <a href=\"/strange-tales/4050-18066/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18066\"> Strange Tales</a> and <a href=\"/menace/4050-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1578\"> Menace</a> all started in the Atlas era.  Some of these series can be directly traced to comics being published today.  However, due to parent outcry because of the violence in these and other horror comics, Martin Goodman had to change their policy and turned most horror comics into more kid-friendly monster comics before finally changing the name of his company once again.  This time he changed the name to <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\"> Marvel</a> -- a name that would last.</p>",

      "deck": "Entertaining Comics, more commonly known as EC Comics, was an American publisher of comic books specializing in horror fiction, crime fiction, satire, military fiction and science fiction from the 1940s through the mid-1950s, most notably the Tales from the Crypt series, until censorship pressures prompted it to concentrate on the seminal humor magazine Mad, which became a major popular culture institution. The publishing company was privately owned by Maxwell Gaines and later, during its period of notoriet",
      "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The firm, first known as Educational Comics, was founded by <a href=\"/max-gaines/4040-46137/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-46137\"> Max Gaines</a>, former editor of the comic-book company All-American Publications. When that company merged with <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\"> DC Comics </a>in 1944, Gaines retained rights to the comic book, Picture Stories from the Bible, and began his new company with a dubious plan to market comics about science, history and the Bible to schools and churches. A decade earlier, Max Gaines had been one of the pioneers of the comic book form, with <a href=\"/eastern-color/4010-22/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-22\"> Eastern Color Printing's</a> proto-comic book<a href=\"/funnies-on-parade/4050-32056/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32056\"> Funnies on Parade</a>, and with<a href=\"/dell/4010-4/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-4\"> Dell Publishing's</a> <a href=\"/famous-funnies/4050-19491/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19491\"> Famous Funnies</a>: A Carnival of Comics considered by many historians to be the first true American comic book.</p><p>When Max Gaines died in 1947 in a boating accident, his son William inherited the comics company. After four years (1942-46) in the Army Air Corps, Gaines had returned home to finish school at New York University, planning to work as a chemistry teacher. He never taught but instead took over the family business. In 1949 and 1950, <a href=\"/bill-gaines/4040-42377/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42377\"> Will Gaines</a> began to introduce series focusing on horror, suspense, science fiction, military fiction and crime fiction. His editors, <a href=\"/al-feldstein/4040-43465/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43465\"> Al Feldstein</a> and <a href=\"/harvey-kurtzman/4040-3909/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3909\"> Harvey Kurtzman</a>, gave assignments to such prominent and highly accomplished freelance artists as <a href=\"/johnny-craig/4040-3934/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3934\"> Johnny Craig</a>, <a href=\"/reed-crandall/4040-31165/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-31165\"> Reed Crandall</a>, <a href=\"/jack-davis/4040-3914/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3914\"> Jack Davis</a>, <a href=\"/william-elder/4040-20234/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-20234\"> Will Elder,</a> <a href=\"/george-evans/4040-26392/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-26392\"> George Evans</a>, <a href=\"/frank-frazetta/4040-5649/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5649\"> Frank Frazetta</a>, <a href=\"/graham-ingels/4040-40150/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40150\"> Graham Ingels</a>, <a href=\"/jack-kamen/4040-40057/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40057\"> Jack Kamen</a>, <a href=\"/bernie-krigstein/4040-40074/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40074\"> Bernard Kriegstein</a>, <a href=\"/joe-orlando/4040-14643/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-14643\"> Joe Orlando</a>, <a href=\"/john-severin/4040-5875/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5875\"> John Severin</a>, <a href=\"/al-williamson/4040-1531/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1531\"> Al Williamson</a>, <a href=\"/basil-wolverton/4040-9666/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9666\"> Basil Wolverton</a>, and <a href=\"/wally-wood/4040-6099/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6099\"> Wally Wood</a>. Kurtzman and Feldstein themselves also drew stories, which generally were written by them and Craig, with assistance from Gaines. Other writers including <a href=\"/carl-wessler/4040-44669/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44669\"> Carl Wessler</a>,<a href=\"/jack-oleck/4040-44730/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44730\"> Jack Oleck</a> and<a href=\"/otto-binder/4040-42374/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42374\"> Otto Binder </a>were later brought on board.</p><p>EC had success with its fresh approach and pioneered in forming relationships with its readers through its letters to the editor and its fan organization, the National EC Fan-Addict Club. While the stories were sensational, the art was highly regarded.</p><p>EC Comics promoted its stable of illustrators, allowing each to sign his art and encouraging them to develop idiosyncratic styles; the company additionally published one-page biographies of them in the comic books. This was in contrast to the industry's common practice, in which credits were often missing, although some artists at other companies, such as the <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\"> Jack Kirby</a>-<a href=\"/joe-simon/4040-9443/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9443\"> Joe Simon</a> team, <a href=\"/jack-cole/4040-42220/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42220\"> Jack Cole</a> and<a href=\"/bob-kane/4040-19137/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-19137\"> Bob Kane </a>had been prominently promoted elsewhere at the time.</p><p>EC published distinct lines of titles under its Entertaining Comics umbrella. Most notorious were its horror books, <a href=\"/tales-from-the-crypt-1950/4050-18612/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18612\"> Tales from the Crypt</a>, <a href=\"/vault-of-horror/4050-11447/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11447\"> The Vault of Horror</a> and <a href=\"/haunt-of-fear/4050-1398/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1398\"> The Haunt of Fear</a>.</p><p>These titles reveled in a gruesome joie de vivre, with grimly ironic fates meted out to many of the stories' protagonists. The company's war comics <a href=\"/frontline-combat/4050-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1443\"> Frontline Combat</a> and <a href=\"/two-fisted-tales/4050-1376/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1376\"> Two-Fisted Tales</a> often featured weary-eyed, unheroic stories out of step with the jingoistic times. <a href=\"/shock-suspenstories/4050-1511/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1511\"> Shock SuspenStories </a>tackled weighty issues such as racism, sex, drug use and the American way of life. EC always claimed to be \"proudest of our science fiction titles\", with <a href=\"/weird-science/4050-18944/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18944\"> Weird Science</a> and <a href=\"/weird-fantasy/4050-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1444\"> Weird Fantasy</a> publishing stories unlike the space opera found in such titles as <a href=\"/fiction-house/4010-8/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-8\"> Fiction House's</a> <a href=\"/planet-comics/4050-816/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-816\"> Planet Comics</a>. <a href=\"/crime-suspenstories/4050-1373/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1373\"> Crime SuspenStories</a> had many parallels with film noir. As noted by<a href=\"/max-allan-collins/4040-56814/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-56814\"> Max Allan Collins</a> in his story annotations for <a href=\"/russ-cochran/4010-2517/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2517\"> Russ Cochran's</a> 1983 hardcover reprint of Crime SuspenStories, Johnny Craig had developed a \"film noir-ish bag of effects\" in his visuals, while characters and themes found in the crime stories often showed the strong influence of writers associated with film noir, notably James M. Cain.</p><p>Superior illustrations of stories with surprise endings became EC's trademark. Gaines would generally stay up late and read large amounts of material while seeking \"springboards\" for story concepts. The next day he would present each premise until Feldstein found one that he thought he could develop into a story. At EC's peak, Feldstein edited seven titles while Kurtzman handled three. Artists were assigned stories specific to their styles. Davis and Ingels often drew gruesome, supernatural-themed stories, while Kamen and Evans did tamer material.</p><p>With hundreds of stories written, common themes became apparent. Some of EC's more well-known themes include:</p><ul><li>An ordinary situation given an ironic and gruesome twist, often as poetic justice for a character's crimes. In \"Collection Completed\" a man takes up taxidermy in order to annoy his wife. When he kills and stuffs her beloved cat, the wife snaps and kills him, stuffing and mounting his body. In \"Revulsion\", a spaceship pilot is bothered by insects due to a past experience when he found one in his food. At the conclusion of the story, a giant alien insect screams in horror at finding the dead pilot in his salad. Dissection, the broiling of lobsters, Mexican jumping beans, fur coats and fishing are just a small sample of the kind of situations and objects used in this fashion.</li><li>The \"Grim Fairy Tale\", featuring gruesome interpretations of such fairy tales as \"Hansel and Gretel\", \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Little Red Riding Hood\".</li><li>Siamese twins were a popular theme, primarily in EC's three horror comics. No less than nine siamese twin stories appeared in EC's horror and crime comics from 1950-1954. In an interview Feldstein speculated that he and Gaines wrote so many siamese twin stories because of the interdependence they had on each other, as if they were siamese twins themselves.</li><li>Adaptations of Ray Bradbury science-fiction stories, which appeared in two dozen EC comics starting in 1952. It began inauspiciously, with an incident in which Feldstein and Gaines plagiarized two of Bradbury's stories and combined them into a single tale. Learning of the story, Bradbury sent a note praising them, while remarking that he had \"inadvertently\" not yet received his payment for their use. EC sent a check and negotiated a productive series of Bradbury adaptations.</li><li>Stories with a political message, which became common in EC's science fiction and suspense comics. Among the many topics were lynching, anti-Semitism and police corruption.</li></ul><p>The three horror titles featured stories introduced by a trio of horror hosts. <a href=\"/the-crypt-keeper/4005-3920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3920\"> The Crypt Keeper</a> introduced Tales from the Crypt, the <a href=\"/the-vault-keeper/4005-3807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3807\"> Vault Keeper </a>welcomed readers to The Vault of Horror and the <a href=\"/the-old-witch/4005-48147/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48147\"> Old Witch</a> cackled over The Haunt of Fear. Besides gleefully recounting the unpleasant details of the stories, the characters squabbled with one another, unleashed an arsenal of puns and even insulted and taunted the readers: \"Greetings, boils and ghouls...\" This irreverent mockery of the audience also became the trademark attitude of <a href=\"/mad/4050-9318/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9318\"> Mad</a>, and such glib give-and-take was later mimicked by many, including<a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\"> Stan Lee </a>at <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\"> Marvel Comics</a>.</p><p>EC's most lasting legacy came with Mad, which started as a side project for Kurtzman before buoying the company's fortunes and becoming one of the country's most notable and enduring humor publications. When satire became an industry rage in 1954 and other publishers created imitations of Mad, EC introduced a sister title, <a href=\"/panic/4050-19325/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19325\"> Panic,</a> edited by Al Feldstein and using the regular Mad artists, plus Joe Orlando.</p><p>Beginning in the late 1940s, the comic book industry became the target of mounting public criticism for the content of comic books and their potentially harmful effects on children. The problem came to a head in 1948 with the publication by <a href=\"/fredric-wertham/4005-6619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6619\"> Dr. Fredric Wertham</a> of two articles: \"Horror in the Nursery\" (in Collier's) and \"The Psychopathology of Comic Books\" (in the American Journal of Psychotherapy). As a result, an industry trade group, the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers, was formed in 1948, but proved ineffective. EC left the association in 1950 after Gaines had an argument with its executive director, Henry Schultz. By 1954 only three comic publishers were still members, and Schultz admitted that the ACMP seals placed on comics were meaningless.</p><p>In 1954, the publication of Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent and a highly publicized Congressional hearing on juvenile delinquency cast comic books in an especially poor light. At the same time, a federal investigation led to a shakeup in the distribution companies that delivered comic books and pulp magazines across America. Sales plummeted, and several companies went out of business.</p><p>Gaines called a meeting of his fellow publishers and suggested that the comic book industry gather to fight outside censorship and help repair the industry's damaged reputation. They formed the Comics Magazine Association of America and its <a href=\"/comics-code-authority/4015-42382/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42382\"> Comics Code Authority</a>. The CCA code expanded on the ACMP's restrictions. Unlike its predecessor, the CCA code was rigorously enforced, with all comics requiring code approval prior to their publication. This not being what Gaines intended, he refused to join the association. Among the Code's new rules were that no comic book title could use the words \"horror\" or \"terror\" or \"weird\" on its cover. When distributors refused to handle many of his comics, Gaines ended publication of his three horror and the two SuspenStory titles on September 14, 1954. EC shifted its focus to a line of more realistic comic book titles, including <a href=\"/md/4050-1733/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1733\"> M.D.</a> and <a href=\"/psychoanalysis/4050-1734/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1734\"> Psychoanalysis</a> (known as the New Direction line). It also renamed its remaining science-fiction comic. Since the initial issues did not carry the Comics Code seal, the wholesalers refused to carry them. After consulting with his staff, Gaines reluctantly started submitting his comics to the Comics Code; all the New Direction titles carried the seal starting with the second issue. This attempted revamp failed commercially and after the fifth issues, all the New Direction titles were canceled.</p><p>Gaines waged a number of battles with the Comics Code Authority in an attempt to keep his magazines free from censorship. In one particular example noted by comics historian Digby Diehl, Gaines threatened Judge Charles Murphy, the Comics Code Administrator, with a lawsuit when Murphy ordered EC to alter the science-fiction story \"Judgment Day.\" The story depicted a human astronaut visiting a planet inhabited by robots as a representative of the Galactic Republic. He finds the robots divided into functionally identical orange and blue races, one of which has fewer rights and privileges than the other. The astronaut decides that due to the robots' bigotry, the Galactic Republic should not admit the planet. In the final panel, he removes his helmet, revealing himself to be a black man. Murphy demanded, without any authority in the Code, that the black astronaut had to be removed. As Diehl recounted in Tales from the Crypt: The Official Archives:</p><p>\"This really made 'em go bananas in the Code czar's office. 'Judge Murphy was off his nut. He was really out to get us', recalls [EC editor] Feldstein. 'I went in there with this story and Murphy says, \"It can't be a Black man\". But ... but that's the whole point of the story!' Feldstein sputtered. When Murphy continued to insist that the Black man had to go, Feldstein put it on the line. 'Listen', he told Murphy, 'you've been riding us and making it impossible to put out anything at all because you guys just want us out of business'. [Feldstein] reported the results of his audience with the czar to Gaines, who was furious [and] immediately picked up the phone and called Murphy. 'This is ridiculous!' he bellowed. 'I'm going to call a press conference on this. You have no grounds, no basis, to do this. I'll sue you'. Murphy made what he surely thought was a gracious concession. 'All right. Just take off the beads of sweat'. At that, Gaines and Feldstein both went ballistic. 'Fuck you!' they shouted into the telephone in unison. Murphy hung up on them, but the story ran in its original form. \"</p><p>Feldstein, interviewed for the book Tales of Terror: The EC Companion, reiterated his recollection of Murphy making the racist request:</p><p>\"So he said it can't be a Black [person]. So I said, 'For God's sakes, Judge Murphy, that's the whole point of the Goddamn story!' So he said, 'No, it can't be a Black'. Bill [Gaines] just called him up [later] and raised the roof, and finally they said, 'Well, you gotta take the perspiration off'. I had the stars glistening in the perspiration on his Black skin. Bill said, 'Fuck you', and he hung up.\"</p><p>Although the story would eventually be printed uncensored in Incredible Science Fiction #33, it was the last comic book ever published by EC. Gaines switched his focus to EC's Picto-Fiction titles, a line of typeset black-and-white magazines with heavily illustrated stories. Fiction was formatted to alternate illustrations with blocks of typeset text, and some of the contents were rewrites of stories previously published in EC's comic books. This experimental line lost money from the start and only lasted two issues per title. When EC's national distributor went bankrupt, Gaines dropped all of his titles except Mad.</p><h3>The Vault of Horror, Tales from the Crypt, and The Haunt of Fear</h3><p>The Vault of Horror, Tales from the Crypt, and The Haunt of Fear are three bi-monthly horror comic anthology series published by EC Comics in the early 1950s. The Vault of Horror hit newsstands with its April/May 1950 issue and ceased publication with its December/January 1955 issue, producing a total of twenty-nine issues. The title was popular, but, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, comic books came under attack from moralizing parents, clergymen, schoolteachers, and others who believed the books contributed to illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In April and June 1954, highly publicized Congressional subcommittee hearings on the effects of comic books upon children left the comics industry shaken. With the imposition of the highly restrictive Comics Code Authority, EC Comics publisher William Maxwell Gaines canceled The Vault of Horror and its two companion titles in September 1954. All three titles have been reprinted at various times since their demise and have been adapted for television and film.</p><p>Horror comics emerged as a distinct comic book genre after World War II when young adult males lost interest in caped crimebusters, and returning GIs wanted titillating sex and violence in their reading. One-shot Eerie Comics (1947) is generally considered the first true horror comic with its cover depicting a dagger-wielding, red eyed ghoul threatening a rope-bound, scantily clad, voluptuous young woman beneath a full moon. In 1948, Adventures Into the Unknown became the first regularly published horror title, enjoying a nearly two decade life-span.</p><p>In 1950, publisher William Gaines and his editor Al Feldstein discovered they shared similar tastes in horror and began experimenting with such stories in EC's crime comic War Against Crime and its companion title, Crime Patrol. With issue #12 of War Against Crime, the title was changed permanently to The Vault of Horror. The Vault Keeper became the title's sardonic host and commentator, occasionally sharing duties with The Old Witch and The Crypt Keeper. Due to an attempt to save money on second-class postage permits, the numbering, however, did not change with the title — the first issue of The Vault of Horror was #12.</p><p>Like its horror companion titles, Tales From the Crypt and The Haunt of Fear, The Vault of Horror had its own distinctive qualities and atmosphere — in this case, created by its main artist, Johnny Craig. Craig illustrated all the covers for the entire run and was responsible for the lead story of all but issues #13 and #33. He also wrote all his own stories (save two) in Vault, something rarely done at EC, and became editor with issue #35 (February, 1954). Gaines and Feldstein wrote almost every other story until late 1953/early 1954 when outside writers Carl Wessler and Jack Oleck were brought in. Other contributing artists to The Vault of Horror were Feldstein, George Evans, Jack Kamen, Wally Wood, Graham Ingels, Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Davis, Sid Check, Al Williamson, Joe Orlando, Reed Crandall, Bernard Krigstein, Harry Harrison and Howard Larsen.</p><p>With The Crypt Keeper and The Old Witch, The Vault-Keeper was one of the hosts for EC's horror comics (known as the GhouLunatics), He served as narrator, and added a lighter touch to the often gruesome stories by using a number of puns. In addition to appearances in his own book, he also had a guest story in each issue of Tales From the Crypt and The Haunt of Fear. Although The Vault-Keeper was originally designed by Al Feldstein, Johnny Craig is the artist most associated with the character, having drawn all his lead stories in the Vault of Horror with the exception of two. Craig would also draw The Vault-Keeper in his guest appearances in the other comics, although another artist frequently drew the rest of the story. For the final four issues of The Vault of Horror, The Vault-Keeper was joined by Drusilla, hostess of the book. The Vault-Keeper appeared in animated form on Tales from the Cryptkeeper and was voiced by Dan Hennessey.</p><p>In 1954, Gaines and Feldstein intended to add a fourth book to their horror publications by reactivating an earlier title, The Crypt of Terror. They were stopped dead in their tracks, however. Horror and other violent comics had come under scrutiny by moralizing parents, schoolteachers, clergymen, psychologists, and others who viewed the material as dangerous to the well-being of children and a significant contributor to the juvenile delinquency crisis in America (although the formulaic nature of the books usually resulted in truly immoral characters receiving a well-deserved, if gruesome, comeupance.) Matters came to a head in April and June 1954 with a highly publicized Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. Hearings targeted violent comic books — which fared poorly in the proceedings. While the committee stopped short of blaming the comics industry for juvenile deliquency, they did suggest it tone down the product. Publishers were left reeling.</p><p>The industry deftly avoided outside censorship by creating the self-regulatory Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) and a Comics Code Authority (CCA) that placed severe restrictions on violent comic book genres. Publishers were forbidden from using the words \"terror\" and \"horror\" in titles, for example, and forbidden from depicting zombies, werewolves, and other gruesome characters and outrè horror fiction trappings. Gaines was fed up; he believed his titles were being specifically targeted and realized they were doomed to future failure. He threw in the towel, canceling The Vault of Horror and its companion titles in September 1954. The last issue of Vault was its twenty-ninth, (#40, December/January 1955). Since an issue of The Crypt of Terror had already been produced, it was published as the final issue of Tales from the Crypt, February/March, 1955.</p>",

      "description": "<b>Avon</b> Books was founded in 1941 by the American News Corporation (ANC) to create a rival to Pocket Books. They hired brother and sister Joseph Myers and Edna Myers Williams to establish the company. ANC bought out J.S. Ogilvie Publications, a pulp magazine publisher partly owned by both the Myers, and renamed it \"Avon Publications\". They also got into comic books. \"The early Avons were somewhat similar in appearance to the existing paperbacks of Pocket Books, resulting in an immediate and largely ineffective lawsuit by that company. Despite this superficial similarity, though, from early on Myers differentiated Avon by placing an emphasis on popular appeal rather than loftier concepts of literary merit.\"] The first 40 titles were not numbered. First editions of the first dozen or so have front and rear endpapers with an illustration of a globe. The emphasis on \"popular appeal\" led Avon to publish ghost stories, sexually-suggestive love stories, fantasy novels and science fiction in its early years, which were far removed in audience appeal from the somewhat more literary Pocket competition.<br/><br/>As well as normal-sized paperbacks, Avon published digest-format paperbacks (the size and shape of the present-day Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine) in series. These included Murder Mystery Monthly, Modern Short Story Monthly and Avon Fantasy Readers. Many authors highly prized by present-day collectors were published in these editions, including A. Merritt, James M. Cain, H. P. Lovecraft, Raymond Chandler and Robert E. Howard.<br/><br/>In 1953, Avon Books sold books in the price range of 25¢ to 50¢ (for the Avon \"G\" series, the \"G\" standing for \"Giant\") and were selling more than 20 million copies a year. Their books were characterized by Time Magazine as \"westerns, whodunits and the kind of boy-meets-girl story that can be illustrated by a ripe cheesecake jacket.\" At around this time, Avon also began to publish under other imprints, including Eton (1951-1953), Novel Library, Broadway and Diversey. Avon's 35-cent \"T\" series, introduced in 1953, also had strong mass-market appeal and contains many outstanding examples of the then-popular juvenile delinquent story. The T series also contained many movie tie-in editions and the stand-bys of mysteries and science fiction.<br/><br/>Avon was bought by the Hearst Corporation in 1959. In 1999, the News Corporation bought out Hearst's book division, and merged Avon with HarperCollins.",

      "deck": "Charlton Comics entered the comic-book business as a way to keep busy the expensive presses they used to publish magazines. As one may imagine, this meant they weren't too critical of the quality of their output. Charlton owned several characters that were later acquired by DC Comics after the company folded.",
      "description": "<h2>Publishing History</h2><p>Charlton Comics was founded in 1946 and went out of business in 1985. The company published comic books in a wide range of genres, reflecting whatever were the variety of popular trends at a given time, much the same way <a href=\"/timely/4010-21/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-21\">Timely</a>/<a href=\"/atlas/4010-75/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-75\">Atlas</a> did. Charlton published War Comics, Horror Comics, Cartoon Comics, Teen comics, Humor Comics, Superhero Comics, Kung Fu Comics, Action Adventure Comics, Romantic Comics and Science Fiction Comics. The wider publishing company published song-lyric magazines (popular in the 1940's), puzzle magazines (of the type often found at supermarket check out lines), Digest-sized story magazines, and paperbacks under the imprints Monarch and Gold Star.</p><p>Charlton began as a magazine printing concern, Charlton Publications, of which comic books were only one small facet. Begun in 1940 under founders John Santangelo, Sr. &amp; Edward Levy, the company was originally called T.W.O. Charles Company, named for the two sons of the co-founders, both of whom were named Charles. The company renamed itself <b>Charlton Publications</b> in 1945. In its early years the company's lead editor was <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/al-fago/4040-64627/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-64627\">Al Fago</a>, brother to Timely comics' lead funny animal artist, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/vince-fago/4040-72832/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-72832\">Vince Fago</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104283/6516865-charltonplantderbyct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6516865\" data-ratio=\"0.33111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:33.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104283/6516865-charltonplantderbyct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6516865\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/104283/6516865-charltonplantderbyct.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/104283/6516865-charltonplantderbyct.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></a></figure><p>Charlton was a unique company in that unlike larger publishing concerns, Charlton's entire production process for its comic books (as well as its other published output) was entirely produced under its own auspices; every phase of production, from Editorial art creation to Printing to Distribution, came directly from the company's editorial headquarters/printing plant in Derby Connecticut. (in fact, that alone would make Charlton unique as a publisher. Photos exist of the offices of \"Charlton Publications\" which feature a massive building -- the printing plant--looking more like the factory it in fact was than a publishing concern)</p><p>While in one way this unique organizational structure gave the company singular control of its product, it also meant that if the company didn't particularly care about the quality of its output, it had to answer to no one (except of course it readers. More on that in a moment). Since the comic-book line was essentially created as a way to keep the company's massive printing facility up and running overnights, (since shutting down the gigantic industrial printers for the night and then starting them up again in the morning would be prohibitively expensive) they were decidedly less critical about the quality exhibited in their comics. Charlton was notorious for the low quality control they exerted over the comics they produced--the quality of their comic-book paper was often a much cheaper grade than higher-end publishers, there was less oversight of the registration of printing plates, so no matter the quality of the artwork, patches of color often floated far and wide from the lines that were meant to border them, and of course because they paid so little, their artists were often less careful about the quality of their artwork or so overworked (adding page count as a way to fill up a decent paycheck) that their books' artwork suffered in comparison to other publishers--- as well as for the extremely low page rates they paid to their artists and writers. At the same time, the company often exerted less stringent editorial control over their comics, which could meant that their artists could exhibit a distinctively expressive personal style even at a time when \"house styles\" were dominant in the comics industry.</p><p>The company's fortunes ebbed and grew across the decades, often dependent on how other larger comics concerns were doing. For example, as the comics boom ebbed after WWII, so did Charlton. As the boom in horror comics in the 50's grew the industry overall, so grew Charlton, if on a smaller scale. Its lead horror title,<a href=\"/thing/4050-36763/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36763\"> <ins>The Thing!</ins></a> featured seminal early work by the young <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> in what was at the time one of the most garish and violent horror comics of the era. Charlton's knack for imitation is most evident in the wake of the 1960's <a href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~lkless/comics.html\" rel=\"nofollow \">Marvel Age of Comics</a>,\" when Ditko left Marvel and lent his talents to Charlton -- precisely <em>BECAUSE</em> of Charlton's lesser editorial control over his work-- and the quality of Charlton's product went up commensurately. The same minor revival happened in the mid-70's, with an influx of fresh new talent to the industry, who could find a welcome work opportunity (and that lower paycheck) at Charlton, always hungry for new talent to exploit. Soon-to-be-stellar artists like <a href=\"/dick-giordano/4040-5584/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5584\">Dick Giordano</a>, who later became editor-in-chief at the company before moving to fame and fortune (and a renowned collaborative partnership with <a href=\"/neal-adams/4040-1768/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1768\">Neal Adams</a>) at DC, <a href=\"/jim-aparo/4040-14272/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-14272\">Jim Aparo</a>, <a href=\"/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-27780\">Frank McLaughlin</a> and others in the 60's, and<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\"> John Byrne</a>, <a href=\"/joe-staton/4040-2056/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2056\">Joe Staton</a>,<a href=\"/wayne-howard/4040-32681/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-32681\"> Wayne Howard</a>, and others in the 1970's got their starts at the Derby, CT based funnybook company.</p><p>As editor, Giordano in the 1960's spearheaded the company's push into the Superhero genre (Giordano preferring to call them \"Action Heroes\") in the company's effort to follow the burgeoning trend in the market. They grew their line, and with the disaffected Ditko at the high end of their creative roster the company made their feeble push into market expansion. While fondly remembered by fans, it remained that the quality of Charlton's product really did pale in comparison to the larger concerns like Marvel &amp; DC, and the sales numbers reflected the tastes of the buying public.</p><p>\"Aw heck, sold out of Spider-Man?\" some gum-chewing moppet would cuss at the newsstand spinner rack, \"I'll have to settle for this lousy Blue Beetle...\"</p><p>Notably, however, Charlton's loose editorial oversight permitted craftsmen like Ditko and his collaborator <a href=\"/joe-gill/4040-51233/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-51233\">Joe Gill</a> to give vent to some of the most extreme <a href=\"/ayn-rand/4040-61601/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61601\">Ayn Randian</a> libertarian politics ever exhibited in comics, in text heavy dialog balloons spouted by characters such as The <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\">Blue Beetle</a> and especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_(comics)\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Question</a>, a character created specifically to embody those political views, and a precursor to Ditko's own later character <a href=\"/mr-a/4005-61540/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61540\">Mr. A</a>. The Question spent most of his career as a backup feature to The Blue Beetle, but did warrant an over-long special issue devoted exclusively to the character, <a href=\"http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=12605\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mysterious Suspense #1</a>, published in 1968 with a 25-page Question story made up of what appears to be shorter pieces intended for backups in the cancelled Blue Beetle title, collected into the longer story for this one-off issue.</p><p>Critical appraisal of most of Charlton's output would rate most of what they produced poorly versus the larger competition, though some genres were superior to others. The superhero books were a pale comparison to the likes of Marvel &amp; DC, but their feeble horror and ghost titles managed to be moody and often downright weirder than their competitors comic-code neutered products. Charlton was a large licensor of characters from other media -- cartoon characters from television and motion pictures, (even oddballs like <a href=\"/hong-kong-phooey/4050-36615/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36615\">Hong Kong Phooey) </a>and comic strip characters such as <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-phantom/4050-2432/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2432\">The Phantom</a>-- and those titles were often a steady stream of income for the company when their attempts at superheroes bombed after a few issues. Some in fandom actually rate <a href=\"https://www.sequentialcrush.com/blog/2010/12/charlton-romance-comic-house-ads\" rel=\"nofollow \">Charlton's Romance comics</a> -- a genre objectively at best a feeble, pallid imitation of real-life at best from almost any company except the likes of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/st-johns-publishing-co/4010-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2043\">St. John</a> in the 50's-- on a par with any of its competitors, even with its rotten printing, off-register colors and coarse, cheap paper.</p><p>Romance comic books were one place where Charlton was able to exhibit some distinction, the comic-book slum of that genre which attracted primarily young female readers and which no boy would admit to reading (but given that the females were well-rendered, drawn primarily by men as unrealistically well-endowed, and often exhibited in passionate embrace with their paramours, almost all male readers did at one time or another, if only to later cast it off after getting the pages stuck together). Larger companies like Atlas and DC produced some distinctive and notable romance titles for some time in the 1950's, 60's and 70's. Some smaller companies like St. John produced romance books that were uniformly excellent (or at least of passable readability, given comics' inability to deal at the time with anything approaching an adult theme. St John at least tried) Charlton was in no place to compete on quality, given its low production values, so they competed by turning out a dizzying volume of romance titles from the late 50's through the early 80's. The company hit its peak from about 1958 to 1966, with just some titles during this period being: <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/brides-in-love/4050-23325/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-23325\">Brides in Love</a>, <a href=\"/cowboy-love/4050-10798/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-10798\">Cowboy Love</a>, <a href=\"/first-kiss/4050-36592/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36592\">First Kiss</a>, <a href=\"/i-love-you/4050-23310/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-23310\">I Love You</a>, <a href=\"/intimate/4050-36758/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36758\">Intimate</a>, <a href=\"/just-married/4050-36620/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36620\">Just Married</a>, <a href=\"/love-diary/4050-23298/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-23298\">Love Diary</a>, <a href=\"/my-secret-life-20-dedication/4000-243877/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-243877\">My Secret Life</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=360171\" rel=\"nofollow \">Negro Romances</a>, Pictorial Love Story, <a href=\"/romantic-secrets/4050-36690/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36690\">Romantic Secrets</a>, <a href=\"/romantic-story/4050-36691/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36691\">Romantic Story</a>, <a href=\"/secrets-of-love-and-marriage/4050-25916/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25916\">Secrets of Love &amp; Marriage</a>, <a href=\"/secrets-of-young-brides/4050-36697/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36697\">Secrets of Young Brides</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sweethearts/4050-36717/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36717\">Sweethearts</a>,<a href=\"/sweetheart-diary/4050-23329/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-23329\"> Sweetheart Diary</a>, <a href=\"/teen-age-love/4050-36757/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36757\">Teen-Age Love</a>, <a href=\"/teen-confessions/4050-1994/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1994\">Teen Confessions</a>, and<a href=\"/teen-age-confidential-confessions/4050-11399/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11399\"> Teen-Age Confidential Confessions</a>. This incomplete list nevertheless is exemplary of a practice used on the company's entire line, and an approach to comic book making: most of these titles were purchased from bankrupt competitor companies, many rehashed the same stories again and again, and examples exist documenting Charlton's note-for-note plagiarizing stories and swiping poses for those stories form other companies. And while the comics code imposed a sterility on these comics that a superior producer like St. John did not have to deal with, these books' art almost makes up for the tired soap opera of the narratives.</p><p>(This practice, of building a stable of titles by purchasing properties from other companies on the verge of insolvency, included characters such as The Blue Beetle, purchased from Fox Publications, and several horror &amp; crime titles from defunct publishers such as <a href=\"/fox-comics-us/4010-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-18\">Fox</a> Comics, Canadian publisher Superior Comics, <a href=\"/mainline/4010-3980/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-3980\">Mainline</a>, the previously mentioned <a href=\"/st-johns-publishing-co/4010-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2043\">St. John</a> and the comic-book division of <a href=\"/fawcett-publications/4010-34/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-34\">Fawcett</a> Publications when that company lost a prolonged legal battle with DC over the alleged <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Comics_Publications,_Inc._v._Fawcett_Publications,_Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow \">copyright infringement of Fawcett's Captain Marvel upon DCs Superman</a>.)</p><p>While it is true that readers of romance comics claim that DC's art was superior to that of Charlton, such is a matter of personal opinion. The author of this paragraph and apparently an extreme fan of romance comic art in general is of the view that from the late 1950's to the mid 1960's, Charlton's romance titles were just as good as those from DC and probably a shade better. At the very least, the artwork, by the likes of <a href=\"/vince-colletta/4040-4256/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4256\">Vince Colletta</a>, Nicholas Alascia, Jon D'Agostino, <a href=\"/sal-trapani/4040-30483/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-30483\">Sal Trapani</a>, Charles Nicholas and others, could stand against the rest of the romance books on the rack, even if Charlton's were more cheaply produced. Colletta in particular excelled at implying a subtle eroticism to his figurative posing in a manner that meant that Charlton could count on the appeal of some of these titles, as mentioned earlier, to easily excite adolescent boys as well as the books' intended audience of young girls (who were simultaneously being drilled on culturally acceptable gender roles at the same time).</p><p>These sorts of business practices were at work at <em>all</em> comic book companies, or at least at the companies that weren't DC or Dell, and Charlton engaged in the same behaviors across all their titles across all genres to a certain extent, at least until the company hit a new stride in the mid 1970's. Nevertheless, for all the originality of a title like <a href=\"/e-man/4050-3286/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3286\">E-Man</a>, there were still the same lame rehashes in the romance, ghost, and war titles right up until the company's demise.</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1257131-007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1257131\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.97689768976898\" data-width=\"303\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 303px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1257131-007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1257131\"><img alt=\"Top Charlton Heroes\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1257131-007.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1257131-007.jpg 303w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px\" data-width=\"303\"></a><figcaption>Top Charlton Heroes</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a> bought the rights to several characters from Charlton Comics, and began exploiting them as their own. When writer <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a> proposed a limited series for DC to be entitled <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/watchmen/4050-3622/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3622\">WATCHMEN</a>, his original concept made use of these moribund Charlton characters. But because a comic book company will rarely kill a potentially moneymaking character property, DC management refused to permit the Charlton acquisitions to be used in Moore's magnum opus, so he adapted them. (e.g. Captain Atom became Dr. Manhattan, The Question became Rorschach, etc.) Several of the Charlton characters made significant appearances in DCs <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> story arc, some might say to lesser dramatic effect. During the Crisis, DC editorially explained where the hell these superheroes had been for all of DCs history by saying that these heroes came from a reality known as Earth-4 and became merged with the New Earth after the Crisis and part of the eventual retcon of the DC Universe. The Charlton heroes from Earth-4 that appeared in the Crisis included <a href=\"/captain-atom/4005-2050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2050\">Captain Atom</a>, <a href=\"/ted-kord/4005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"/nightshade/4005-4881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4881\">Nightshade</a>, <a href=\"/peacemaker/4005-14371/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14371\">Peacemaker</a>, <a href=\"/judomaster/4005-18995/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18995\">JudoMaster</a>, <a href=\"/thunderbolt/4005-4894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4894\">Thunderbolt</a> and the <a href=\"/question/4005-3211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3211\">Question</a>. Not every hero was bought by DC Comics. One such minor hero was <a href=\"/mercury-man/4005-71497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71497\">Mercury Man</a>. He was a hero from a post apocalyptic planet <a href=\"/mercury/4020-56298/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56298\">Mercury</a>. Another was E-Man, who had been decidedly more popular.</p><p>In 1996 Roger Broughton, owner of Sword In Stone Productions, purchased the rights to the remaining Charlton Comics and characters (the <a href=\"/the-fightin-5/4050-34594/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-34594\">Fightin’ 5</a>, <a href=\"/\">Gunmaster</a> &amp; Bullet Boy, and <a href=\"/atomic-rabbit/4050-36552/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36552\">Atomic Rabbit</a>, and after being bought from Fawcett, Don Winslow) that had not been bought by DC comics, who now own the rights to most of Charlton’s superheroes. Later he also bought the rights to the titles and characters of the old ACG comics group ( <a href=\"/magicman/4005-38564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38564\">Magicman</a>, <a href=\"/john-force/4005-38482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38482\">John Force: Magic Agent</a>, <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-38695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38695\">Nemesis</a>, Herbie “the <a href=\"/herbert-popnecker/4005-38595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38595\">Fat Fury</a>” <a href=\"/herbert-popnecker/4005-38595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38595\">Popnecker</a>, the <a href=\"/hooded-horseman/4005-74394/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74394\">Hooded Horseman</a>, <a href=\"/cowboy-sahib/4005-61473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61473\">Cowboy Sahib</a>, and Commander Battle and his Atomic Sub.)</p><p>In 2002 he changed the name of his company to the \"Charlton Media Group\". Since then he has announced attempts to revive the various titles and characters that he owns, but so far nothing new has come of it other than a number of reprints of Charlton and ACG material in Europe, and the licensing of the rights to produce new Nemesis, Magicman and Herbie stories to Dark Horse as yet the other characters remain untouched. Thus far his attempts to make good on his questionable investment has been unsuccessful.</p><h2>Charlton's Greatest Heroes</h2><p><ins><em><strong>So many of Charlton's characters were bought by DC Comics that the Top Charlton Characters list to the left of the page is very inaccurate. Many of Charlton's more famous heroes are here on ComicVine attributed to DC and instead of being<em><strong> correctly</strong></em> attributed to <em><strong>Charlton</strong></em>. This leaves some of Charlton's greatest characters in the dark.</strong></em></ins></p><p>Nevertheless, it remains true that some of Charlton's biggest successes themselves did not originate at the company. Blue Beetle, for example changed hands 3 times before being acquired by Charlton and being given a successful makeover. It should also be noted that because of Charlton's wide range of genres covered that they did not have an extensive pantheon of heroes, at least compared to companies like DC Comics and <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a>. They did have several heroes however that made up a cool list. Many of these heroes went on to have a big legacy in the DC Universe. Below is an alphabetized list of Charlton's more famous Characters:</p><p><b>Blue Beetles</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1309954\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3206751054852\" data-width=\"237\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 237px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1309954\"><img alt=\"Ted Kord - Blue Beetle\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" data-width=\"237\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex.jpg 237w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ted Kord - Blue Beetle\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex.jpg 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" data-width=\"237\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ted Kord - Blue Beetle</figcaption></figure><p>There is probably no hero more loved in all of Charlton Comics than the Blue Beetle. Charlton bought the rights to the original <a href=\"/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\">Blue Beetle</a> Dan Garret from <a href=\"/fox/4010-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-18\">Fox Comics</a>. This eventually (in a way) kept him out of the Public Domain unlike his counterparts <a href=\"/samson/4005-52544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52544\">Samson</a> and the <a href=\"/the-flame/4005-24757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24757\">Flame</a> from the same publisher.</p><p>Despite the popularity of the original Blue Beetle, Charlton completely rebooted the character. He had different powers, origin, occupation, secondary characters and even his last name had a different spelling with an extra t. Unfortunately for the character he was not as popular after the reboot as he was before so to solve the problem they decided to reboot the character again. This time Dan was killed off and <a href=\"/ted-kord/4005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\">Ted Kord</a> became the next Blue Beetle. Ted Kord was created by <a href=\"/joe-gill/4040-51233/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-51233\">Joe Gill</a> and <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a>.</p><p>When DC bought the rights to the characters they bought both <a href=\"/dan-garret/4005-18745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18745\">Dan Garrett</a> (with two t's) and Ted Kord and continued on this the story instead of starting over with the original Dan Garret (with one t). This technically means that the Dan Garret (with one t) is suppose to be in public domain but it is difficult to clarify with name similarities and so not much has been done with it. <a href=\"/dynamite-entertainment/4010-1859/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1859\">Dynamite Entertainment</a> revamp the character and called him <a href=\"/scarab/4005-6238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6238\">Scarab</a>.

Originally the character's name was Allen Adam (or \"Captain Adam,\" in what passed for clever wordplay in Charlton books) when the property was bought out by DC comics his name was changed to Nathaniel Christopher Adam. His costume was also changed several times. There were two three main costumes however and one of them may have been a printing mistake.</p><p>In the first issue Captain Atom has a blue costume on the inside of the book but a gold one on the cover. He did then wear the gold costumes for quite a while with small variations until he went to the blue and red costume with the silver arms. It wasn't until he went to DC that his costume changed to the mostly silver costume he wears today</p><p><b>E-Man and Nova Kane</b></p><p><a href=\"/e-man/4050-2603/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2603\">E-Man</a> was a character introduced during the company's last major revival in the mid 1970's, and proved that the firm could produce entertaining, engaging comics even at its typical bottom-of-the-barrel rates. The character, and his girlfriend, exotic dancer turned superheroine <a href=\"/nova-kane/4005-36079/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36079\">Nova Kane</a>, were not purchased by DC but attempts have been made to revive the characters by companies like <a href=\"/first/4010-324/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-324\">First Comics</a> and <a href=\"/comico/4010-336/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-336\">Comico</a>. The characters were created by <a href=\"/nicola-cuti/4040-52990/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-52990\">Nicola Cuti</a> and <a href=\"/joe-staton/4040-2056/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2056\">Joe Staton</a>. E-Man was a being from outer space who existed as pure energy, and was discovered by Nova, an exotic dancer. E-Man modeled himself after the humans he saw and could blast energy, turn into pure energy and distort his form much as the classic character <a href=\"/plastic-man/4005-6270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6270\">Plastic Man</a> could. Cuti's well-executed scripts and Staton's strong, appealing art were decidedly more lighthearted than most superheroes of the time and that quality helped differentiate the book from others on the racks, and the book soon became the sales leader for the company (with the exception of its huge line of animated character licenses, which were being sold for very young children). It certainly helped to sell the book that Nova was designed as an attractive and well-proportioned redhead, and was often portrayed in various states of undress. Even so, the title has a cheery innocence about it that was never sullied by Nova's bustline or midriff on display. Cuti and Charlton eventually turned Nova into a superhero as well with the same powers as E-Man, which allowed Staton to draw her in a skimpy skintight one-piece costume. The title featured a variety of intriguing back-up features, several by Steve Ditko, including his decidedly oddball character Killjoy, and eventually settled on a backup featuring a charming robot called <a href=\"/rog-2000/4005-36080/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36080\">Rog-2000</a> which featured very appealing early professional work by a young <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\">John Byrne</a>.</p><p><b>Judo Master and Tiger</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1310475-19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310475\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.91709844559585\" data-width=\"193\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 193px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1310475-19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310475\"><img alt=\"Tiger and Judo Master\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px\" data-width=\"193\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1310475-19.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1310475-19.jpg 193w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tiger and Judo Master\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1310475-19.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1310475-19.jpg 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px\" data-width=\"193\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tiger and Judo Master</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/judomaster/4005-18995/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18995\">Judo Master</a> was created by <a href=\"/joe-gill/4040-51233/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-51233\">Joe Gill</a> and <a href=\"/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-27780\">Frank McLaughlin</a>.

Created by Steve Ditko, the character was intended to express the burgeoning philosophy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)\" rel=\"nofollow \">Objectivism </a>which had grown fervently in Ditko's consciousness throughout his career at Marvel (and perhaps contributed to his decision to finally leave the company). The Question was quite distinctive and was considered one of Charlton's more successful heroes even though his own series was limited to backup features in other books and a single issue of his own (published under the title <a href=\"http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=12605\" rel=\"nofollow \">\"Mysterious Suspense Featuring The Return of The Question</a>\" in 1968, a book made up of backup stories building a single story arc, collected from the backup stories intended for the cancelled Blue Beetle title). The same year Charlton released that book, Ditko distilled the Ayn Randian concepts in The Question even further into a character he called <a href=\"http://www.vicsage.com/misc/mistera.php\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mr. A</a> which was introduced in the third issue of Wally Wood's independent underground magazine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witzend\" rel=\"nofollow \">WITZEND</a>.</p><p>After being acquired by DC Comics in their purchase of a large number of Charlton characters, the Question, thoroughly rinsed of Ditko's often impenetrable philosophy, became quite popular in his own title self titled comic and the <a href=\"/the-question-quarterly/4050-4374/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4374\">Question Quarterly</a>. The Question became popular again in the<a href=\"/justice-league-unlimited/4075-57/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-57\"> Justice League Unlimited</a> cartoons and the <a href=\"/52/4050-18053/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18053\">52</a> series where he died of cancer and passed the torch on to<a href=\"/renee-montoya/4005-3716/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3716\"> Renee Montoya</a>.</p><p><b>Sarge Steel</b></p><p><a href=\"/sarge-steel/4005-9931/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9931\">Sarge Steel</a> was created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Masulli\" rel=\"nofollow \">Pat Masulli</a> and made his first appearance in <a href=\"/sarge-steel/4050-2271/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2271\">Sarge Steel</a> #1. Sarge Steel was not an a typical hero and was private eye and Viet Nam veteran. His name and power came from his hand that was formed in a fist.</p><p>When Sarge Steel came to DC Comics his character became more entrenched as a government agent, an admittedly derivative variation designed to add depth to the character and provide better fodder for plotting stories. The character was frequently combined with with Project X and the <a href=\"/suicide-squad/4050-3815/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3815\">Suicide Squad</a>. This has put him in a situation of being pitted against and worked for the more costumed superheroes. It has <em>not</em>, however, put him in a situation of being more interesting as a character.</p><p><b>Son of Vulcan</b></p><p><a href=\"/son-of-vulcan/4005-30891/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30891\">Son of Vulcan</a> was also created by Pat Musulli with the help of penciler <a href=\"/bill-fraccio/4040-38070/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-38070\">Bill Fraccio</a>. Son of Vulcan was really Johnny Mann who was several injured in war and cursed the gods who allowed him to end up this way. His prayer/plea does not go unanswered as Vulcan himself arrives and tells him his troubles or not of the gods by the failures of man. Not only that but Vulcan gives him the power to fight for justice.</p><p><b>Thunderbolt</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1313491\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5895865237366\" data-width=\"653\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 653px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1313491\"><img alt=\"Thunderbolt &amp; Yang\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg 653w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thunderbolt &amp; Yang\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg 653w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thunderbolt &amp; Yang</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/thunderbolt/4005-4894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4894\">Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt</a> was created by <a href=\"/pete-morisi/4040-2625/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2625\">Pete Morisi</a>.

Marvel had sought to publish a comics version of the popular television show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kung Fu</a> but were denied the rights so they created their own martial arts character in the same mold, <a href=\"/master-of-kung-fu/4050-2697/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2697\">Master of Kung Fu</a>. As stated earlier, Charlton sought to follow the trends, and created Yang after seeing the success of the Marvel book. Yang was a Kung Fu fighter and sometimes didn't fit the superhero mold to some. Whatever fan disagreements there may be, he wore a costume and set out to fight crime, even wearing a costume that was the same issue to issue. The title Yang ran for 14 issues under Charlton's management. The Charlton title <a href=\"/house-of-yang/4050-2719/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2719\">House of Yang,</a> running only 6 issues, featured distinctive artwork by the sadly underutilized <a href=\"/san-ho-kim/4040-11347/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-11347\">Sanho Kim</a> in one of his too-rare appearances in American publications. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanho_Kim\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kim </a>was one of the only artists working in America to make use of the Korean <a href=\"/manhwa-the-world-of-korea-comics-2004-sampler/4050-47928/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-47928\">Manhwa </a>style of comics.</p>",

      "description": "<p> </p><p><b>Youthful</b> (which was also known as <b>Youthful Magazines</b>) operated during the late Golden Age (1949–1954). The company was reportedly owned by attorney Bill and Sophie Friedman. Other principals reportedly included Lew Stricof and S. Wind, George Ungar and Morton Myers. Harry Donenfeld (of DC publishing fame) was also reported to be financially involved in Youthful. There is speculation that some of the switches of titles between imprints as discussed below were due to disagreements between creditors.</p><p>Youthful and its related imprints have been described as \"A circular group of owners hiding behind a lot of fake addresses. \" (See the history at http://dccomicsartists.com/dchistory/youthful-story.htm) At times, the imprints associated with the same titles and owners included</p><ul><li><strong>Story</strong></li><li><b>Master</b></li><li><b>Premier</b></li><li><b>Wester</b><strong>n</strong>, and</li><li><b>Pix-Parade Comics</b></li></ul><p>Youthful et al eschewed superheros.

Notable volumes included <i>Gunsmoke</i>, <i>Indian Fighter</i>, and <i>Redskin</i> (later known as <i>Famous Western Badmen</i>); <i>Captain Science</i> (later <i>Fantastic</i>, <i>Beware</i>, and <i>Chilling Tales</i>), and <i>Jackpot </i>(humor).</p><p><i>Gunsmoke</i> was the publisher's first title, and debuted Apr./May 1949, running until 1952. Youthful began publishing <i>Youthful Hearts</i> in its own name in 1952 (previously published under the Pix-Parade imprint). In 1953 its numbering continued under the new title <i>Daring Confessions</i>. The Youthful titles <i>Attack</i> and <i>Beware</i> were re-branded Trojan in 1952, which continued their numbering. Youthful, in turn, renamed the titles <i>Atomic Attack</i> and <i>Chilling Tales</i>, respectively, also continuing the numbering.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Publisher Israel Waldman had a great idea in the late 1950's: He knew there had been a LOT of comic books published, and a LOT of those were by companies no longer in business, so why not reprint the output of those comics companies and foist them on a youthful buying public that hadn't seen them before? Years before today's trend in glossy reprints of public-domain comics, Waldman grabbed work from several defunct publishers (among them the renowned <a href=\"/quality-comics/4010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-15\">QUALITY</a> Comics, <a href=\"/avon/4010-121/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-121\">Avon</a>, <a href=\"/fox/4010-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-18\">Fox</a>, <a href=\"/toby/4010-123/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-123\">Toby</a>, <a href=\"/magazine-enterprises/4010-84/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-84\">Magazine Enterprises</a>, Harry A. <a href=\"/harry-a-cheslerdynamic/4010-1884/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1884\">Chesler</a>, and others) and re-issued them with new covers -- and sometimes new titles: <a href=\"/dan-garret/4005-18745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18745\">The Blue Beetle</a> appeared in a comic book titled \"<a href=\"/human-fly/4050-1920/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1920\">The Human Fly</a>\" for just one example-- and at times, without even bothering to receive legal authorization to actually <i>produce</i> those reprints. It seemed a sure-fire way to easy money-- low production costs, low overhead, and, if the covers were appealing enough, an unsuspecting audience eager for new titles. </p><p>I.W. and its quickly-created partner company Super Comics, released Westerns, Humor, Funny Animals, Superheroes, Horror, Science Fiction, Romance, War, seemingly anything they could get their hands on. Regardless of the contents of the books, it is often amusing to see what sort of misleading cover has been put on these reprints. It may be rewarding to inspect the publisher's output at The <a href=\"http://www.digitalcomicmuseum.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Digital Comics Museum,</a> and a very interesting article on I.W. by T. Casey Brennan appeared in the 57th issue of <a href=\"/comics-journal/4050-35609/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35609\">The Comics Journal</a> from June 1980.</p><p>Nevertheless, sometimes a product is seen as what it actually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit\" rel=\"nofollow \">is</a>, and I.W./Super was out of business by 1964. Waldman went on to found the <a href=\"/warren/4010-173/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-173\">Warren</a>-inspired <a href=\"/skywald/4010-214/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-214\">SKYWALD</a> line of B&amp;W Horror Magazines with Marvel production chief <a href=\"/sol-brodsky/4040-6100/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6100\">Sol Brodsky</a>.</p>",

Magazine started when Warren noticed that baby boomer children wathcing old horror movies in television shows that each had a monster host, were actually rooting for the monsters. He wanted to create similar thing in magazine format. The first number sold out in days and later on the magazine had a print run of 200 000 copies.</p><p>In 1960 Warren started to publish Help! magazine. It employed many former MAD artists and was edited by Harvey Kurtzman. During it´s five year run, Help! had many collaborators who later on became famous, Terry Gilliam, Gloria Steinem, John Cleese and Woody Allen. It also featured underground comics by Robert Crumb and Gilberts Shelton.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/6263-2194-6839-1-creepy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6263\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/6263-2194-6839-1-creepy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6263\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/6263-2194-6839-1-creepy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/6263-2194-6839-1-creepy.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure><p> </p><p>The monster comics Warren published in MONSTER WORLD expanded to two legendary horror comics, CREEPY and EERIE. Warren was able to avert the Comics Code cencorship by claiming that his publication was not in fact a comic, but due to pricing and format a magazine. This was also to protect James Warren from the fate that EC publisher BILL GAINES suffered in front of a Congressional committee.</p><p>Warren also published openly anti-war war comic, BLAZING COMBAT in 1965-66. He later said that from everything he published, he was most proud from these four issues. Because of the content of BLAZING COMBAT, the U.S. Army PXs refused to sell it, and when other wholesalers were threatening to drop every WARREN publications from their shelves because of BC, it was ended.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7374\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.34\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7374\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><p>In 1969 Warren launched it´s third classic horror comic, VAMPIRELLA.

      "description": "<p>Gold Key Comics was created in 1962, when Western switched to in-house publishing rather than packaging content for branding and distribution by its business partner, <a href=\"/dell/4010-4/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-4\">Dell Comics</a>. Hoping to make their comics more like traditional children's books they initially eliminated panel borders (using strips of color instead) and had word and thought balloons that were rectangular rather than oval. Within a year they had reverted to using inked panel borders and oval balloons. They also experimented with new formats, including black and white 136 page hardcovers containing reprints (<a href=\"/whitman/4010-68/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-68\">Whitman Comic Books</a>) and tabloid sized 52 page hardcovers containing new material (Golden Picture Story Book). These evidently were aimed at the book trade and department stores, in the manner of their popular Little Golden Books. In 1967 they reprinted a number of selected issues of their comics under the title Top Comics which were sold in plastic bags of 5 at gas stations and various eateries; some locations removed them from the bags and sold them individually with price stickers attached to the covers.</p><p>A striking difference between Gold Key and other publishers (which had been done by Dell as well) was to publish most of their mystery, jungle, science-fiction, adventure and similar series with full color painted covers rather than the standard line-artwork.</p><p>Gold Key featured a number of licensed properties and several original titles (including a number of publications that spun-off from Dell's <a href=\"/four-color/4050-927/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-927\">Four Color</a> series). It maintained decent sales numbers throughout the 1960s, thanks to its offering many titles based upon popular TV series of the day, as well as numerous titles based upon both <a href=\"/walt-disney-company-italia/4010-290/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-290\">Walt Disney Studios</a> and Warner Bros. animated properties. It was also the first company to publish comic books based upon <a href=\"/star-trek/4050-2364/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2364\">Star Trek</a>.</p><p>Over the years it did lose several properties, including the <a href=\"/king-features-syndicate/4010-198/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-198\">King Features Syndicate</a> characters (<a href=\"/popeye/4005-32957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32957\">Popeye,</a> <a href=\"/flash-gordon/4005-7953/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7953\">Flash Gordon</a>, <a href=\"/the-phantom/4005-7957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7957\">The Phantom</a>, etc) in 1966, the <a href=\"/hanna-barbera-hi-adventure-heroes/4050-34337/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-34337\">Hanna Barbera</a> characters (to <a href=\"/charlton/4010-125/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-125\">Charlton Comics</a>) in 1970, and Star Trek (to <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a>) in 1979.</p><p>The stable of writers and artists built up by Western Publishing during the Dell Comics era mostly continued into the Gold Key era. In the mid-60s a number of artists left to work for the newly formed Disney Studio Program. Among the few new creators at Gold Key were writers <a href=\"/don-glut/4040-57469/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-57469\">Don Glut</a>, <a href=\"/len-wein/4040-41457/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41457\">Len Wein</a> and <a href=\"/mark-evanier/4040-26413/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-26413\">Mark Evanier</a> and artist <a href=\"/mike-royer/4040-7366/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7366\">Mike Royer</a>. Also in the 70s writer <a href=\"/bob-gregory/4040-31834/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-31834\">Bob Gregory</a> started drawing stories, mostly for <a href=\"/daisy-duck/4005-21550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21550\">Daisy</a> and <a href=\"/donald-duck/4005-22182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22182\">Donald</a>. Acclaimed artist/writer <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller</a> had his first published comic book artwork in The <a href=\"/twilight-zone/4050-2102/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2102\">Twilight Zone</a> for Gold Key in 1978.</p><p>According to former Western Publishing writer <a href=\"/mark-evanier/4040-26413/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-26413\">Mark Evanier</a>, during the mid-1960s comedy writer Jerry Belson (whose writing partner at the time was Garry Marshall), while writing for leading TV sitcoms like The Dick Van Dyke Show, also did scripts for Gold Key. Among the comics he wrote for were <a href=\"/flintstones/4050-11612/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11612\">The Flintstones</a>, <a href=\"/the-best-of-donald-duck-and-uncle-scrooge/4050-2197/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2197\">Uncle Scrooge</a>, <a href=\"/daffy-duck/4050-9559/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9559\">Daffy Duck</a>, <a href=\"/bugs-bunny/4050-11508/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11508\">Bugs Bunny</a>, <a href=\"/the-three-stooges/4050-2100/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2100\">The Three Stooges</a> and <a href=\"/walter-lantz-woody-woodpecker/4050-11012/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11012\">Woody Woodpecker</a>.</p><p>In the 1970s, when the comics industry experienced a downswing, Gold Key was among the hardest hit. Its editorial policies had not kept pace with changing times and suffered erosion of its base of sales among children who could now instead watch cartoons and other entertainment on free television. By 1977, all of the company's original series had been canceled (most had been dropped circa 1973-1974), and its licensed series were virtually all reprint-only, although Gold Key was still able to obtain the rights to publish a comic book series based upon <a href=\"/buck-rogers-in-the-25th-century/4050-3017/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3017\">Buck Rogers</a> in the 25th Century between 1979 and 1981.</p><p>In this period Gold Key experimented with digests which had some success. In a similar vein to explore new markets they produced in the mid-1970s a four volume series with somewhat better production values and printing aimed at the emerging collector market containing classic stories of the Disney characters by <a href=\"/carl-barks/4040-23923/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-23923\">Carl Barks</a> and <a href=\"/floyd-gottfredson/4040-52268/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-52268\">Floyd Gottfredson</a> (Best of Walt Disney's Comics). In the late 1970s came somewhat higher grade reprints of various licensed characters also aimed at new venues (Dynabrites) plus a four issue series adapting classic science fiction stories by authors such as Issac Asimov and John W. Campbell (Starstream). Golden Press released trade paperback reprint collections (Walt Disney Christmas Parade, Bugs Bunny Comics-Go-Round, Star Trek Enterprise Logs). And while still distributing comic books on spinners and racks at drug stores, super markets and such under the Gold Key label simultaneously distributing the same comics — usually in plastic bags of three — to toy and department stores plus newsstands at airports and bus/train stations \"as well as other outlets that weren't conducive to conventional comic racks\" under the Whitman logo which it also used for such products as coloring books. Western at one point also distributed bagged comics from its rivals DC Comics and Marvel Comics under the Whitman logo. President of <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a> <a href=\"/paul-levitz/4040-41154/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41154\">Paul Levitz</a> has stated \"The Western program was enormous — even well into the '70s they were taking very large numbers of DC titles for distribution (I recall 50,000 copies offhand).\" Continued declining sales forced Western in 1981 to cease newsstand distribution and thereafter release all its comics solely in bags as \" <a href=\"/whitman/4010-68/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-68\">Whitman Comics</a>\". The \"Gold Key\" logo was discontinued. Eventually arrangements were made to distribute these releases to the nascent national network of comic book stores as part of the Whitman alternate methods of distribution. All these efforts proved ultimately unsuccessful, and by 1984 Western was out of the comic book business.</p><p>Many of their characters have been revived over the decades by companies ranging from <a href=\"/valiant/4010-485/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-485\">Valiant</a> to <a href=\"/dark-horse-comics/4010-364/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-364\">Dark Horse</a> who recently revived and published some of their more memorable characters. Dynamite has the publishing rights to the major/well known Gold Key characters.</p><p>Some of the stable of characters that were originally published were:</p><p><a href=\"/magnus/4005-12457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12457\">Magnus</a> (Gold Key, Valiant, Dark Horse, Dynamite)</p><p><a href=\"/doctor-solar/4005-39277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39277\">Dr. Solar</a> (Gold Key, Valiant, Dark Horse, Dynamite)</p><p><a href=\"/turok/4005-7171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7171\">Turok</a> (Dell, Gold Key, Valiant, Dark Horse, Dynamite)</p><p><a href=\"/mars-patrol/4060-57706/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57706\">M.A.R.S.

      "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Red Circle Comics began publishing in October of 1973, after <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-2563\" href=\"/chilling-adventures-in-sorcery-as-told-by-sabrina/4050-2563/\" slug=\"chilling-adventures-in-sorcery-as-told-by-sabrina\">Chilling Adventures in Sorcery as told by Sabrina</a></i> was turned over to them after its second issue was released. After passing into Red Circle's control, it was retitled as simply <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2627\" href=\"/chilling-adventures-in-sorcery/4050-2627/\" slug=\"chilling-adventures-in-sorcery\"><i>Chilling Adventures in Sorcery</i></a> and released under this title for the following three issues. It was retitled again with the sixth issue, taking the name <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2671\" href=\"/red-circle-sorcery/4050-2671/\" slug=\"red-circle-sorcery\"><i>Red Circle Sorcery</i></a>. The title lasted for a further five issues before being cancelled. In 1974 Red Circle published a single issue of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-24366\" href=\"/super-cops/4050-24366/\" slug=\"super-cops\"><i>The Super Cops</i></a>, and several issues of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2670\" href=\"/mad-house/4050-2670/\" slug=\"mad-house\"><i>Mad House</i></a>. In early 1975 <i>Mad House</i> was taken from Red Circle's control and re-assimilated into the main Archie line. Red Circle did not publish anything for the next four years until, in 1979, they released two digests of superhero material that was originally released by Archie in the 1960s, under the titles <i>Archie's Super Hero Special</i> and <i>Archie's Super Hero Comic Digest Magazine #2</i>.</p><p>This period of occasional dormancy was followed in the 1980s with a resurgence in the attempted use of Archie's superhero properties. Red Circle released a number of revived titles after the 1983 revival of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3215\" href=\"/the-mighty-crusaders/4050-3215/\" slug=\"the-mighty-crusaders\"><i>The Mighty Crusaders</i></a>. Some of the revived titles included <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3211\" href=\"/blue-ribbon-comics/4050-3211/\" slug=\"blue-ribbon-comics\"><i>Blue Ribbon Comics</i></a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3212\" href=\"/the-comet/4050-3212/\" slug=\"the-comet\"><i>The Comet</i></a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3213\" href=\"/the-fly/4050-3213/\" slug=\"the-fly\"><i>The Fly</i></a>. In February of 1984 this new line was retitled as <a data-ref-id=\"4010-174\" href=\"/archie-adventure-series/4010-174/\" slug=\"archie-adventure-series\">Archie Adventure Series</a>. By September of 1985 all new titles in this line had been cancelled. There were plans to revive them under a new title, but these plans did not result in anything. Red Circle ceased publication, and Archie's superhero properties were leased to <a data-ref-id=\"4010-10\" href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" slug=\"dc-comics\">DC Comics</a>.</p><h2>Titles</h2><p>During its first phase of publication, 1973-1979, Red Circle released</p><p><i>Chilling Adventures in Sorcery</i> #3-5</p><p><i>Red Circle Sorcery</i> #6-11</p><p><i>Mad House</i> #95-97</p><p><i>Super Cops</i> #1</p><p><i>Archie's Super Hero Special</i></p><p><i>Archie's Super Hero Comic Digest Magazine</i> #2</p><p>During its second phase of publication, 1980-1985, Red Circle released</p><p><i>Blue Ribbon Comics</i> #1-14</p><p><i>The Comet</i> #1-2</p><p><i>The Fly</i> #1-9</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3214\" href=\"/lancelot-strong-the-shield/4050-3214/\" slug=\"lancelot-strong-the-shield\"><i>Lancelot Strong: The Shield</i></a>, later retitled <i>Shield-Steel Sterling</i>, later retitled <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3329\" href=\"/steel-sterling/4050-3329/\" slug=\"steel-sterling\">Steel Sterling</a></i>, #1-7</p><p><i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3327\" href=\"/mantech-robot-warriors/4050-3327/\" slug=\"mantech-robot-warriors\">ManTech Robot Warriors</a></i> #1-4</p><p><i>Mighty Crusaders</i> #1-13</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3328\" href=\"/the-original-shield/4050-3328/\" slug=\"the-original-shield\"><i>Original Shield</i></a> #1-4</p>",
