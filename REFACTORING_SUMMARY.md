# HTTP Client Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the @comic-vine/client library to move store logic (cache, dedupe, rate limiting) from the high-level ComicVine client into the HTTP transport layer, following the separation of concerns principle.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `HttpClient` (`packages/client/src/http-client/http-client.ts`)

#### New Interfaces Added:

- `HttpClientStores`: Interface for optional store dependencies
- `HttpClientOptions`: Interface for configuration options

#### Constructor Changes:

- Now accepts `HttpClientStores` and `HttpClientOptions` parameters
- Stores are completely optional - client works without any stores

#### New Methods Added:

- `inferResource(url: string)`: Extracts resource name from API URL for rate limiting
- `parseUrlForHashing(url: string)`: Extracts endpoint and params for request hashing

#### Enhanced `get()` Method:

The `get()` method now implements the complete middleware pipeline:

1. **Cache Check**: First checks if cached result exists
2. **Deduplication**: Checks for in-progress requests and registers new ones
3. **Rate Limiting**: Enforces rate limits before making requests
4. **HTTP Request**: Executes the actual HTTP request
5. **Post-processing**: Records rate limit usage, caches results, and completes deduplication

### 2. Updated `HttpClientFactory` (`packages/client/src/http-client/http-client-factory.ts`)

- Modified `createClient()` to accept stores and options
- Factory now properly injects dependencies into HttpClient

### 3. Refactored `ComicVine` Class (`packages/client/src/comic-vine.ts`)

#### Removed Code:

- Removed `executeWithStores()` method (moved to HttpClient)
- Removed `createWrappedResource()` method
- Removed `wrapRetrieveMethod()` and `wrapListMethod()` methods
- Removed `hasStores()` method
- Removed all store wrapping logic from resource methods

#### Simplified Logic:

- Resources are now created directly without wrapping
- Stores are passed to HttpClientFactory during construction
- Store management methods (clearCache, getRateLimitStatus, etc.) are preserved

### 4. Updated Exports (`packages/client/src/http-client/index.ts`)

- Added export for `HttpClient` class and its types
- Consumers can now import HttpClient types if needed

## Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- HTTP transport layer now handles all middleware concerns
- Domain logic (resources) is clean and focused on business logic
- Store logic is centralized in one place

### 2. **Better Testability**

- HttpClient can be tested in isolation with mock stores
- Resource classes can be tested without store complexity
- Clear separation makes mocking easier

### 3. **Improved Maintainability**

- Store logic is no longer duplicated across retrieve/list methods
- Changes to store behavior only need to be made in one place
- Easier to add new store types or modify existing ones

### 4. **Backwards Compatibility**

- Public API remains unchanged
- Existing client code continues to work without modifications
- Store behavior is identical to previous implementation

## Files Modified

1. `packages/client/src/http-client/http-client.ts` - Added store middleware
2. `packages/client/src/http-client/http-client-factory.ts` - Updated factory
3. `packages/client/src/comic-vine.ts` - Removed store wrapping logic
4. `packages/client/src/http-client/index.ts` - Updated exports

## Files Created

1. `packages/client/src/http-client/http-client-with-stores.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite for the refactored HttpClient

## Key Features Implemented

### Request Hashing

- Proper URL parsing to extract endpoint and parameters
- Consistent hashing for cache keys and deduplication

### Resource Inference

- Automatic extraction of resource names from API URLs
- Support for different Comic Vine API endpoints

### Error Handling

- Proper error propagation through the middleware pipeline
- Deduplication failure handling

### Store Integration

- Cache: GET → SET → CLEAR workflow
- Deduplication: REGISTER → WAIT → COMPLETE/FAIL workflow
- Rate Limiting: CHECK → RECORD workflow

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite covering:

- Cache hit/miss scenarios
- Deduplication workflows
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Resource inference accuracy
- Error handling
- Client behavior without stores

## TypeScript Compilation

✅ All TypeScript compilation checks pass
✅ No type errors or warnings
✅ Proper type safety maintained throughout refactoring

## Summary

The refactoring successfully moved all store logic from the high-level client to the HTTP transport layer while maintaining:

- Full backwards compatibility
- Type safety
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability

The HTTP client now serves as a proper middleware layer that can be easily extended with additional stores or modified without affecting the domain logic.
