# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use Changesets

1. **Add a changeset**: Run `pnpm changeset` to add a new changeset describing your changes
2. **Version packages**: Run `pnpm version-packages` to consume changesets and update package versions
3. **Publish packages**: Run `pnpm release` to build and publish packages to npm

## Workflow

When you make changes to a package:

1. Make your changes
2. Run `pnpm changeset` and describe your changes
3. Commit the changeset file along with your changes
4. When ready to release, run `pnpm version-packages` to update versions
5. Commit the version changes
6. Run `pnpm release` to publish
